>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
> 
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
>       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

>       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
>       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,

>       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
>       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
>       as of the date such litigation is filed.
> 
>    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the

>           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
>           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>           the Derivative Works; and
> 
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
>           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>           as modifying the License.
> 
>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
> 
>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
> 
>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

>       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
> 
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>       a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial content
>          Distributed under this Agreement, and
> 
>       b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor: 
>          i) changes to the Program, and 
>          ii) additions to the Program;
>       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from
>       and are Distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution
>       "originates" from a Contributor if it was added to the Program by
>       such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such Contributor's behalf.
>       Contributions do not include changes or additions to the Program that
>       are not Modified Works.
> 
>     "Contributor" means any person or entity that Distributes the Program.
> 
>     "Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which
>     are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone
>     or when combined with the Program.
> 
>     "Program" means the Contributions Distributed in accordance with this
>     Agreement.
> 
>     "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement
>     or any Secondary License (as applicable), including Contributors.
> 
>     "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source Code or other
>     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Program and for which the
>     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
>     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship.
> 
>     "Modified Works" shall mean any work in Source Code or other form that
>     results from an addition to, deletion from, or modification of the
>     contents of the Program, including, for purposes of clarity any new file
>     in Source Code form that contains any contents of the Program. Modified

>     in any manner that enables the transfer of a copy.

> 
>     2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
> 
>       a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
>       grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright
>       license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display,
>       publicly perform, Distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such
>       Contributor, if any, and such Derivative Works.
> 
>       b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby
>       grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
>       license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,
>       import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor,
>       if any, in Source Code or other form. This patent license shall
>       apply to the combination of the Contribution and the Program if, at
>       the time the Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition
>       of the Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the
>       Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any other
>       combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
>       licensed hereunder.
> 
>       c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
>       licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are
>       provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the
>       patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity.
>       Each Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims
>       brought by any other entity based on infringement of intellectual
>       property rights or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the
>       rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
>       assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual
>       property rights needed, if any. For example, if a third party
>       patent license is required to allow Recipient to Distribute the
>       Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to acquire that license
>       before distributing the Program.
> 
>       d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has
>       sufficient copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant
>       the copyright license set forth in this Agreement.
> 
>       e) Notwithstanding the terms of any Secondary License, no
>       Contributor makes additional grants to any Recipient (other than
>       those set forth in this Agreement) as a result of such Recipient's
>       receipt of the Program under the terms of a Secondary License
>       (if permitted under the terms of Section 3).
> 
>     3. REQUIREMENTS
> 
>     3.1 If a Contributor Distributes the Program in any form, then:
> 
>       a) the Program must also be made available as Source Code, in
>       accordance with section 3.2, and the Contributor must accompany
>       the Program with a statement that the Source Code for the Program
>       is available under this Agreement, and informs Recipients how to
>       obtain it in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
>       used for software exchange; and
> 
>       b) the Contributor may Distribute the Program under a license
>       different than this Agreement, provided that such license:
>          i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all other Contributors all
>          warranties and conditions, express and implied, including
>          warranties or conditions of title and non-infringement, and
>          implied warranties or conditions of merchantability and fitness
>          for a particular purpose;
> 
>          ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all other Contributors all
>          liability for damages, including direct, indirect, special,
>          incidental and consequential damages, such as lost profits;
> 
>          iii) does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
>          in the Source Code under section 3.2; and
> 
>          iv) requires any subsequent distribution of the Program by any
>          party to be under a license that satisfies the requirements
>          of this section 3.
> 
>     3.2 When the Program is Distributed as Source Code:
> 
>       a) it must be made available under this Agreement, or if the
>       Program (i) is combined with other material in a separate file or
>       files made available under a Secondary License, and (ii) the initial
>       Contributor attached to the Source Code the notice described in
>       Exhibit A of this Agreement, then the Program may be made available
>       under the terms of such Secondary Licenses, and
> 
>       b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of
>       the Program.
> 
>     3.3 Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright, patent,
>     trademark, attribution notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations
>     of liability ("notices") contained within the Program from any copy of
>     the Program which they Distribute, provided that Contributors may add
>     their own appropriate notices.
> 
>     4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
> 
>     Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities
>     with respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this
>     license is intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program,
>     the Contributor who includes the Program in a commercial product
>     offering should do so in a manner which does not create potential
>     liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if a Contributor includes
>     the Program in a commercial product offering, such Contributor
>     ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify every
>     other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses,
>     damages and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits
>     and other legal actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified

>     Preamble
> 
>     The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
>     share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
>     intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
>     make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
>     License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
>     to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
>     Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
>     Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
>     When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
>     Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
>     freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
>     service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
>     want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
>     free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>     To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
>     to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
>     restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
>     distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
>     For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
>     or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
>     You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
>     And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
>     We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
>     (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
>     distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
>     Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
>     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
>     software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
>     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
>     that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
>     authors' reputations.
> 
>     Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
>     We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
>     individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
>     proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
>     be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
>     The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
>     modification follow.
> 
>     TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
>     0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
>     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
>     the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
>     to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
>     either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
>     to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
>     verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
>     (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
>     "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
>     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
>     covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
>     the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
>     covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
>     (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
>     is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
>     1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
>     code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
>     and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
>     and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
>     this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
>     recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
>     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
>     you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
>     2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
>     it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
>     such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
>     that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>         a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>         b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>         whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>         thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>         under the terms of this License.
> 
>         c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>         when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>         interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>         announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>         that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>         warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>         conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>         (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>         normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>         is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
>     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
>     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
>     can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
>     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
>     sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
>     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
>     the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
>     License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
>     whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
>     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
>     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
>     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
>     collective works based on the Program.
> 
>     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
>     with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
>     storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
>     scope of this License.
> 
>     3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
>     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
>     Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>         a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>         source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>         and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>         b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>         years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>         of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>         machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>         distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>         customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>         c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>         distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>         only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>         program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>         accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
>     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
>     making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
>     means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
>     associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
>     compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
>     exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
>     normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
>     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
>     which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
>     executable.
> 
>     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
>     to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
>     the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
>     code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
>     along with the object code.
> 
>     4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
>     except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
>     to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
>     automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
>     who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
>     not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
>     full compliance.
> 
>     5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
>     signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
>     distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
>     prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
>     modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
>     Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
>     its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
>     Program or works based on it.
> 
>     6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
>     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
>     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
>     these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
>     on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
>     responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
>     7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
>     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
>     conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
>     otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
>     excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
>     so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
>     any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
>     distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
>     not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
>     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
>     could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
>     distribution of the Program.
> 
>     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
>     any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
>     apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
>     circumstances.
> 
>     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
>     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
>     such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
>     integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
>     by public license practices. Many people have made generous
>     contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
>     system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
>     the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
>     software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
>     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
>     a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
>     8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
>     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
>     original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
>     add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
>     countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
>     not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
>     limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
>     9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
>     versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
>     versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
>     differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
>     Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
>     specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
>     later version", you have the option of following the terms and
>     conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
>     the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
>     number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
>     Free Software Foundation.
> 
>     10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
>     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
>     author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
>     Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
>     sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
>     two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
>     software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
>     NO WARRANTY
> 
>     11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
>     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
>     EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
>     OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
>     EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
>     WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
>     ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
>     YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
>     NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>     12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
>     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
>     AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
>     DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
>     DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
>     (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
>     INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
>     THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR

>     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
>     If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
>     possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
>     free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

>     To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to

> 
> 3. Distribution Obligations.
> 
>     3.1. Availability of Source Code.
> 
>     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
>     in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
>     and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
>     of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
>     copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
>     or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
>     Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
>     Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
>     through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
> 
>     3.2. Modifications.
> 
>     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
>     governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
>     believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
>     have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
> 
>     3.3. Required Notices.
> 
>     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
>     identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
>     remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
>     within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
>     descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
>     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
>     IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
>     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
>     THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
>     DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
>     OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
>     REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
>     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
>     AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
>     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
>     termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
>     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
>     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
>     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
>     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
>     Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
>     from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
>     expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
>     day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
>     Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
>     a written agreement with Participant.
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
>     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>     license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
>     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
>     INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
>     COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
>     TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
>     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
>     FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
>     LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
>     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
>     APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
>     PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
>     LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
>     LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
>     AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
> 
> 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
> 
>     The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
>     in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
>     software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. S
>     252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
>     as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent

> 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
> 
>     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
>     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
>     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent

>     the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
>     the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
>     provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
>     provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject

>     with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
>     limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
>     The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
>     the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
>     regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
>     construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
>     agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
>     States export administration regulations (and the export control
>     laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
>     or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
>     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.

> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

>     descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
>     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
>     IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
>     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
>     THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
>     DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
>     OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
>     REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
>     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
>     AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
>     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
>     termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
>     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
>     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

>           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>           the Derivative Works; and
> 
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not

>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>           as modifying the License.
> 
>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed

>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
> 
>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
>     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
>     IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
>     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
>     THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
>     DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
>     OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
>     REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
>     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
>     AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
>     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
>     termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
>     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
>     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
>     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
>     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
>     Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
>     from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
>     expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
>     day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
>     Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
>     a written agreement with Participant.
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
>     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>     license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
>     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
>     INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
>     COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
>     TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
>     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
>     FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
>     LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
>     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
>     APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
>     PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
>     LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
>     LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
>     AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
> 
> 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

>     The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
>     in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
>     software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. S

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
>     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
> 
>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

> 
>     3.1. Availability of Source Code. 
> 
>     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available in 
>     Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form and that 
>     Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms of this 
>     License. You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
>     Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise 
>     make available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software 
>     in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in 
>     Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium 
>     customarily used for software exchange. 
> 
>     3.2. Modifications. 
> 
>     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are 
>     governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You believe 
>     Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You have 
>     sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License. 
> 
>     3.3. Required Notices. 
> 
>     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that identifies 
>     You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or alter 
>     any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered 
>     Software, or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
>     attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms. 
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source 
>     Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of this 
>     License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
>     and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability 
>     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software. However, you 
>     may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial 
>     Developer or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any 
>     such warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by 
>     You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and 
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or 
>     such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or 
>     liability terms You offer. 
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. 
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under the 
>     terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
>     which may contain terms different from this License, provided that You 
>     are in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license 
>     for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the 
>     recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set forth in 
>     this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in Executable form 
>     under a different license, You must make it absolutely clear that any 
>     terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by 
>     the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the 
>     Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by 
>     the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms 
>     You offer. 
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works. 
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with other 
>     code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger 
>     Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the 
>     requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 
> 
> 4. Versions of the License. 
> 
>     4.1. New Versions. 
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or new 
>     versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be given a 
>     distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one 
>     other than the license steward has the right to modify this License. 
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions. 
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered 
>     Software available under the terms of the version of the License under 
>     which You originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
>     Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from 
>     being distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent 
>     version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered 
>     Software available under the terms of the version of the License under 
>     which You originally received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may 
>     also choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software 
>     available under the terms of any subsequent version of the License 
>     published by the license steward. 
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions. 
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new license 
>     for Your Original Software, You may create and use a modified version of 
>     this License if You: (a) rename the license and remove any references to 
>     the name of the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
>     from this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license 
>     contains terms which differ from this License.

>     DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
>     THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
>     SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY 
>     RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME

>     DISCLAIMER. 
> 
> 6. TERMINATION. 
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate 
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure 
>     such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
>     which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of 
>     this License shall survive. 
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory 
>     judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the 
>     Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You assert such claim is 
>     referred to as "Participant") alleging that the Participant Software 
>     (meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is a Contributor 
>     or the Original Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) 
>     directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights 
>     granted directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial 
>     Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
>     Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 
>     60 days notice from Participant terminate prospectively and 
>     automatically at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
>     within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the 
>     Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally or 
>     pursuant to a written agreement with Participant. 
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant 
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly infringes 
>     any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by license or 
>     settlement) prior to the initiation of patent infringement litigation, 
>     then the reasonable value of the licenses granted by such Participant 
>     under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken into account in determining the 
>     amount or value of any payment or license. 
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all 
>     end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any 
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses granted 
>     to You by any distributor) shall survive termination. 
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT 
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL 
>     DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED 
>     SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 
>     PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES 
>     OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF 
>     GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL 
>     OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN 
>     INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF 
>     LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY 
>     RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW 
>     PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
>     OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION 
>     AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

> 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

> Preamble 
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to 
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is 
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to 
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public 
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and 
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free 
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General 
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too. 
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. 
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the 
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this 
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you 
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new 
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things. 
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone 
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These 
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you 
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it. 
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis 
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. 
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. 
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. 
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and 
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, 
> distribute and/or modify the software. 
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain 
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free 
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we 
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so 
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original 
> authors' reputations. 
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. 
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will 
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program 
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must 
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. 
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and 
> modification follow. 
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a 
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under 
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers 
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means 
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is 
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term 
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you". 
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not 
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running 
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is 
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program 
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that 
> is true depends on what the Program does. 
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source 
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously 
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice 
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to 
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other 
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program. 
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and 
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of 
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute 
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided 
> that you also meet all of these conditions: 
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating 
>     that you changed the files and the date of any change. 
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole 
>     or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, 
>     to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the 
>     terms of this License. 
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when 
>     run, you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in 
>     the most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an 
>     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or 
>     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may 
>     redistribute the program under these conditions, and telling the user 
>     how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is 
>     interactive but does not normally print such an announcement, your work 
>     based on the Program is not required to print an announcement.) 
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If 
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and 
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in 
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those 
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you 
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on 
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this 
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. 
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest 
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to 
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or 
> collective works based on the Program. 
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program 
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a 
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the 
> scope of this License. 
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under 
> Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 
> 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following: 
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source 
>     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 
>     above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to 
>     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically 
>     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the 
>     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 
>     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, 
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to 
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only 
>     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in 
>     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with 
>     Subsection b above.) 
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for 
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code 
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any 
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control 
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special 
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is 
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major 
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on 
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the 
> executable. 
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access 
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy 
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source 
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source 
> along with the object code. 
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program 
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise 
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will 
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties 
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will 
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in 
> full compliance. 
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not 
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or 
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are 
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by 
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the 
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all 
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
> Program or works based on it. 
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the 
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the 
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to 
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions 
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not 
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent 
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), 
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or 
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not 
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute 
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and 
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not 
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would 
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who 
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
> distribution of the Program. 
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under

> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any 
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any 
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the 
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented 
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous 
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that 
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to 
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute 
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
> choice. 
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be 
> a consequence of the rest of this License. 
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in 
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the 
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may 
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those 
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries 
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the 
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.

> Free Software Foundation. 
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free

> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we 
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the

> 
> 3. Distribution Obligations.
> 
>     3.1. Availability of Source Code.
> 
>     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
>     in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
>     and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
>     of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
>     copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
>     or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
>     Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such

>     through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
> 
>     3.2. Modifications.
> 
>     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
>     governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
>     believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
>     have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
> 
>     3.3. Required Notices.
> 
>     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
>     identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
>     remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
>     within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
>     descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
>     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
>     IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
>     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
>     THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
>     DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
>     OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
>     REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
>     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
>     AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
>     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
>     termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
>     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
>     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
>     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
>     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
>     Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
>     from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
>     expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
>     day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
>     Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
>     a written agreement with Participant.
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
>     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>     license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
>     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
>     INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
>     COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
>     TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
>     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
>     FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
>     LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
>     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
>     APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
>     PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
>     LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
>     LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
>     AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
> 
> 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

>     The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
>     in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
>     software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. S
>     252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
>     as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent

>     construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
>     agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
>     States export administration regulations (and the export control
>     laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
>     or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
> 
> 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and

> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
>     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>
> 
>     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify

>           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
>           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>           the Derivative Works; and
> 
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
>           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>           as modifying the License.
> 
>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
>       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
>       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
>       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
>       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
> 
>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
> 
>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
>       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
>       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
>       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
>       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
>       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
>       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
>       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
>       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
> 
>    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
>       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
> 
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,

> 
> THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS ECLIPSE PUBLIC
> LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM
> CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.
> 
> 1. DEFINITIONS
> 
> "Contribution" means:
> 
>       a) in the case of the initial Contributor, the initial code and
>          documentation distributed under this Agreement, and
>       b) in the case of each subsequent Contributor:
> 
>       i) changes to the Program, and
> 
>       ii) additions to the Program;
> 
>       where such changes and/or additions to the Program originate from and are
> distributed by that particular Contributor. A Contribution 'originates' from a
> Contributor if it was added to the Program by such Contributor itself or anyone
> acting on such Contributor's behalf. Contributions do not include additions to
> the Program which: (i) are separate modules of software distributed in
> conjunction with the Program under their own license agreement, and (ii) are
> not derivative works of the Program. 
> 
> "Contributor" means any person or entity that distributes the Program.
> 
> "Licensed Patents " mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor which are
> necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution alone or when
> combined with the Program.
> 
> "Program" means the Contributions distributed in accordance with this Agreement.
> 
> "Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this Agreement,
> including all Contributors.
> 
> 2. GRANT OF RIGHTS
> 
>       a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
> Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright license to
> reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
> distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, and
> such derivative works, in source code and object code form.
> 
>       b) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby grants
> Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license under
> Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell, import and otherwise
> transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if any, in source code and
> object code form. This patent license shall apply to the combination of the
> Contribution and the Program if, at the time the Contribution is added by the
> Contributor, such addition of the Contribution causes such combination to be
> covered by the Licensed Patents. The patent license shall not apply to any
> other combinations which include the Contribution. No hardware per se is
> licensed hereunder. 
> 
>       c) Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the
> licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are provided by
> any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the patent or other
> intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each Contributor disclaims
> any liability to Recipient for claims brought by any other entity based on
> infringement of intellectual property rights or otherwise. As a condition to
> exercising the rights and licenses granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby
> assumes sole responsibility to secure any other intellectual property rights
> needed, if any. For example, if a third party patent license is required to
> allow Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility to
> acquire that license before distributing the Program.
> 
>       d) Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient
> copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright license
> set forth in this Agreement. 
> 
> 3. REQUIREMENTS
> 
> A Contributor may choose to distribute the Program in object code form under
> its own license agreement, provided that:
> 
>       a) it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement; and
> 
>       b) its license agreement:
> 
>       i) effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties and
> conditions, express and implied, including warranties or conditions of title
> and non-infringement, and implied warranties or conditions of merchantability
> and fitness for a particular purpose; 
> 
>       ii) effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability for
> damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and consequential
> damages, such as lost profits; 
> 
>       iii) states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are
> offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party; and
> 
>       iv) states that source code for the Program is available from such
> Contributor, and informs licensees how to obtain it in a reasonable manner on
> or through a medium customarily used for software exchange. 
> 
> When the Program is made available in source code form:
> 
>       a) it must be made available under this Agreement; and 
> 
>       b) a copy of this Agreement must be included with each copy of the
> Program. 
> 
> Contributors may not remove or alter any copyright notices contained within the
> Program.
> 
> Each Contributor must identify itself as the originator of its Contribution, if
> any, in a manner that reasonably allows subsequent Recipients to identify the
> originator of the Contribution.
> 
> 4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION
> 
> Commercial distributors of software may accept certain responsibilities with
> respect to end users, business partners and the like. While this license is
> intended to facilitate the commercial use of the Program, the Contributor who
> includes the Program in a commercial product offering should do so in a manner
> which does not create potential liability for other Contributors. Therefore, if
> a Contributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering, such
> Contributor ("Commercial Contributor") hereby agrees to defend and indemnify
> every other Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against any losses, damages
> and costs (collectively "Losses") arising from claims, lawsuits and other legal
> actions brought by a third party against the Indemnified Contributor to the
> extent caused by the acts or omissions of such Commercial Contributor in
> connection with its distribution of the Program in a commercial product
> offering. The obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses
> relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement. In order
> to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly notify the Commercial
> Contributor in writing of such claim, and b) allow the Commercial Contributor
> to control, and cooperate with the Commercial Contributor in, the defense and
> any related settlement negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may
> participate in any such claim at its own expense.
> 
> For example, a Contributor might include the Program in a commercial product
> offering, Product X. That Contributor is then a Commercial Contributor. If that
> Commercial Contributor then makes performance claims, or offers warranties
> related to Product X, those performance claims and warranties are such
> Commercial Contributor's responsibility alone. Under this section, the
> Commercial Contributor would have to defend claims against the other
> Contributors related to those performance claims and warranties, and if a court
> requires any other Contributor to pay any damages as a result, the Commercial
> Contributor must pay those damages.
> 
> 5. NO WARRANTY
> 
> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED ON AN
> "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR
> IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE,
> NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each
> Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using
> and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise
> of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and
> costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of
> data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.
> 
> 6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY
> 
> EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR ANY
> CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
> SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST
> PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT,
> STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY
> WAY OUT OF THE USE OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS
> GRANTED HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> 7. GENERAL
> 
> If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under applicable
> law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
> terms of this Agreement, and without further action by the parties hereto, such
> provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
> provision valid and enforceable.
> 
> If Recipient institutes patent litigation against any
> entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
> Program itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or
> hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's rights
> granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
> filed.
> 
> All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it fails to
> comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this Agreement and does
> not cure such failure in a reasonable period of time after becoming aware of
> such noncompliance. If all Recipient's rights under this Agreement terminate,
> Recipient agrees to cease use and distribution of the Program as soon as
> reasonably practicable. However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement
> and any licenses granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue
> and survive.
> 
> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute copies of this Agreement, but in
> order to avoid inconsistency the Agreement is copyrighted and may only be
> modified in the following manner. The Agreement Steward reserves the right to
> publish new versions (including revisions) of this Agreement from time to time.
> No one other than the Agreement Steward has the right to modify this Agreement.
> The Eclipse Foundation is the initial Agreement Steward. The Eclipse Foundation may assign the responsibility to
> serve as the Agreement Steward to a suitable separate entity. Each new version
> of the Agreement will be given a distinguishing version number. The Program
> (including Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of
> the Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new version of
> the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to distribute the Program
> (including its Contributions) under the new version. Except as expressly stated
> in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above, Recipient receives no rights or licenses to
> the intellectual property of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether
> expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not
> expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.
> 
> This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and the

CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN 'AS-IS' BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE INFORMATION PROVIDED, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

> License
> 
> THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ('CCPL' OR 'LICENSE'). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
> 
> BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
> 
> 1. Definitions
> a. 'Collective Work' means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License.
> b. 'Derivative Work' means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ('synching') will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
> c. 'Licensor' means the individual or entity that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
> d. 'Original Author' means the individual or entity who created the Work.
> e. 'Work' means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this License.
> f. 'You' means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous violation.
> 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
> 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
> a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
> b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works;
> c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
> d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works.
> e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the work is a musical composition:
> i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work.
> ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ('cover version') and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
> f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
> The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
> 
> 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
> a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit as required by clause 4(b), as requested.
> b. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., 'French translation of the Work by Original Author,' or 'Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author'). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
> 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
> UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
> 
> 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 7. Termination
> a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
> b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
> 8. Miscellaneous
> a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
> b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
> c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
> d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
> e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
> Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

> -------------------
> 
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
> 
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
> 
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
> 
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
> 
> (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
> 
> (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
> 
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
> 
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
> 
> 3.4. Notices
> 
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
> 
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
> 
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
> ---------------------------------------------------
> 
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
> 
> 5. Termination
> --------------
> 
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
> 
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
> 
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.

> 						Preamble
> 		
> 		The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
> 		Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
> 		semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
> 		while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
> 		the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make
> 		reasonable modifications.
> 		
> 		Definitions:
> 		
> 			"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
> 			Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files
> 			created through textual modification.
> 		
> 			"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
> 			modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes
> 			of the Copyright Holder as specified below.
> 		
> 			"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or
> 			copyrights for the package.
> 		
> 			"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
> 			this Package.
> 		
> 			"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the
> 			basis of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved,
> 			and so on.  (You will not be required to justify it to the
> 			Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large
> 			as a market that must bear the fee.)
> 		
> 			"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
> 			itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
> 			It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it
> 			under the same conditions they received it.
> 		
> 		1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
> 		Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
> 		duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
> 		
> 		2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
> 		derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder.  A Package
> 		modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
> 		
> 		3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
> 		that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
> 		when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
> 		following:
> 		
> 		    a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
> 		    Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or
> 		    an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
> 		    site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
> 		    your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
> 		
> 		    b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.
> 		
> 		    c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
> 		    with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
> 		    a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
> 		    documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
> 		
> 		    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
> 		
> 		4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
> 		executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
> 		
> 		    a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
> 		    together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where
> 		    to get the Standard Version.
> 		
> 		    b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
> 		    the Package with your modifications.
> 		
> 		    c) give non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly
> 		    document the differences in manual pages (or equivalent), together
> 		    with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.
> 		
> 		    d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
> 		
> 		5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
> 		Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
> 		Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package itself.  However,
> 		you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
> 		commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial) software
> 		distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a
> 		product of your own.  You may embed this Package's interpreter within
> 		an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be construed as a mere
> 		form of aggregation, provided that the complete Standard Version of the
> 		interpreter is so embedded.
> 		
> 		6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
> 		output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
> 		under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whoever generated
> 		them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
> 		Package.  If such scripts or library files are aggregated with this
> 		Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" methods of producing a
> 		binary executable image, then distribution of such an image shall
> 		neither be construed as a distribution of this Package nor shall it
> 		fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, provided that you do
> 		not represent such an executable image as a Standard Version of this
> 		Package.
> 		
> 		7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled subroutines in other
> 		languages) supplied by you and linked into this Package in order to
> 		emulate subroutines and variables of the language defined by this
> 		Package shall not be considered part of this Package, but are the
> 		equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided these subroutines do
> 		not change the language in any way that would cause it to fail the
> 		regression tests for the language.
> 		
> 		8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial distribution is always
> 		permitted provided that the use of this Package is embedded; that is,
> 		when no overt attempt is made to make this Package's interfaces visible
> 		to the end user of the commercial distribution.  Such use shall not be
> 		construed as a distribution of this Package.

> 
> 3. Distribution Obligations.
> 
>     3.1. Availability of Source Code.
> 
>     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
>     in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
>     and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
>     of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every
>     copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute
>     or otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any such
>     Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can obtain such
>     Covered Software in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or
>     through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
> 
>     3.2. Modifications.
> 
>     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
>     governed by the terms of this License. You represent that You
>     believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
>     have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License.
> 
>     3.3. Required Notices.
> 
>     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
>     identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
>     remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices contained
>     within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing or any
>     descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or the
>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
>     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
>     IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
>     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
>     THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
>     DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
>     OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
>     REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
>     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
>     AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
>     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
>     termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
>     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
>     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
>     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
>     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
>     Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
>     from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
>     expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
>     day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
>     Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
>     a written agreement with Participant.
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
>     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>     license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
>     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
>     INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
>     COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
>     TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
>     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
>     FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
>     LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
>     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
>     APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
>     PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
>     LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
>     LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
>     AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
> 
> 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.
> 
>     The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
>     in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
>     software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. AS
>     252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation"
>     as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
>     with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
>     (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
>     with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
>     clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
>     clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
>     software under this License.
> 
> 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
> 
>     This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
>     matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
>     unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
>     necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
>     the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
>     the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
>     provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
>     provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
>     to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
>     venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
>     with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
>     limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
>     The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
>     the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
>     regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
>     construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
>     agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
>     States export administration regulations (and the export control
>     laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
>     or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
> 
> 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
> 
>     As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
>     responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
>     out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
>     work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
>     responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
>     shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program

> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED

> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL

> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of

>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
>

>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
>

> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,

> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free

> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.

> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
> placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
> this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
> or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
> derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
> Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
> translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
> without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
> "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
> this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
> not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
> constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
> running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
> you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
> disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
> and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
> Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
> at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
> forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
> or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
> these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
>     that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
>     in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
>     licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
>     this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
>     you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
>     most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
>     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
>     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
>     the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
>     of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
>     not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
>     not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
> sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
> considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
> its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
> works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
> work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
> of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
> rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
> right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
> the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
> Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
> distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
> License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
> Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
> 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
>     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
>     on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
>     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
>     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
>     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
>     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
>     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
>     Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
> modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
> the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
> definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
> of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
> distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
> source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
> of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
> itself accompanies the executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
> from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
> code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
> third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
> expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
> sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
> your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
> rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
> long as such parties remain in full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
> However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
> or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
> accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
> any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
> do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
> the Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
> the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
> copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
> You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
> rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
> third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
> are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
> contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
> conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
> simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
> obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
> For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
> of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
> you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
> refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
> particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
> the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
> other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
> section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
> distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
> people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
> distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
> system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
> distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
> choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
> consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
> countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
> copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
> geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
> distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
> such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
> of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
> General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
> spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
> or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
> version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
> that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
> If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
> choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
> whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
> permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
> write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
> Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
> all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
> software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
> THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
> STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
> PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
> INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
> FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
> PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
> YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
> ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
> PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
> GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
> INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
> BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
> FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
> OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
> use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
> which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
> them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
> of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
> pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
>

>     Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make available
>     in Executable form must also be made available in Source Code form
>     and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
>     of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every

>     through a medium customarily used for software exchange.
> 
>     3.2. Modifications.
> 
>     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are

>     3.3. Required Notices.
> 
>     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
>     identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not

>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
>

>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by

>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>     license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any

> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to

>         otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.
> 
>         (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is
>         granted: (1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from

>         other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered
>         Software in the absence of Modifications made by that
>         Contributor.
> 
> 3. Distribution Obligations.
>    
>     3.1. Availability of Source Code.  Any Covered Software that You
>     distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must
>     also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code
>     form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. You
>     must include a copy of this License with every copy of the Source
>     Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise make
>     available. You must inform recipients of any such Covered Software
>     in Executable form as to how they can obtain such Covered Software
>     in Source Code form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
>     customarily used for software exchange.
> 
>     3.2. Modifications.  The Modifications that You create or to which
>     You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. You
>     represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your original
>     creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to grant the rights
>     conveyed by this License.
>    
>     3.3. Required Notices.  You must include a notice in each of Your
>     Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of the
>     Modification.  You may not remove or alter any copyright, patent
>     or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, or any
>     notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to
>     any Contributor or the Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.  You may not offer or impose
>     any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form that alters
>     or restricts the applicable version of this License or the
>     recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
>     charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
>     obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf
>     of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.  You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
>     a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
>     offer.
>    
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.  You may distribute the
>     Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms of this
>     License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, which may
>     contain terms different from this License, provided that You are
>     in compliance with the terms of this License and that the license
>     for the Executable form does not attempt to limit or alter the
>     recipient's rights in the Source Code form from the rights set
>     forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered Software in
>     Executable form under a different license, You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
>     offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
>     and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
>     offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.  You may create a Larger Work by combining
>     Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of this
>     License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In
>     such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this License
>     are fulfilled for the Covered Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license
>     steward and may publish revised and/or new versions of this
>     License from time to time. Each version will be given a
>     distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 4.3,
>     no one other than the license steward has the right to modify this
>     License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.  You may always continue to use,
>     distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
>     the terms of the version of the License under which You originally
>     received the Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes a
>     notice in the Original Software prohibiting it from being
>     distributed or otherwise made available under any subsequent
>     version of the License, You must distribute and make the Covered
>     Software available under the terms of the version of the License
>     under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of
>     any subsequent version of the License published by the license
>     steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.  When You are an Initial Developer and You
>     want to create a new license for Your Original Software, You may
>     create and use a modified version of this License if You: (a)
>     rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
>     license steward (except to note that the license differs from this
>     License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the license
>     contains terms which differ from this License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
> COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
> WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
> WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF
> DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
> NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
> THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
> DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
> CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
> CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART
> OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED
> HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
>     breach. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect
>     beyond the termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
>     the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
>     the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
>     the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
>     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
>     the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
>     under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
>     notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
>     at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
>     such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
>     Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
>     or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
>     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
>     taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
>     payment or license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
>     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
> UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
> (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
> DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED
> SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
> PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
> OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
> GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND
> ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE
> BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
> LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
> RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
> PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
> EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
> THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

> 8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

> The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is defined
> in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer
> software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. S 252.227-7014(a)(1))
> and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are
> used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
> and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
> U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
> rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu
> of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision
> that addresses Government rights in computer software under this
> License.

> 9. MISCELLANEOUS.
> 
> This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
> matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be

> the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within the
> Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
> provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
> provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
> to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
> venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
> with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
> limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and
> expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
> Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly
> excluded. Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
> contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not apply to
> this License. You agree that You alone are responsible for compliance
> with the United States export administration regulations (and the
> export control laws and regulation of any other countries) when You
> use, distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.
> 
> 10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.
> 
> As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
> responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
> out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
> work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
> and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
> guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
> software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
> most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
> authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
> covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
> General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
> distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
> that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
> the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
> can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
> you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
> translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
> software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
> a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
> make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
> show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
> offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
> and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
> everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
> software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
> know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
> by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
> wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
> To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
> everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
> follow.
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
> placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
> this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
> or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
> derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
> Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
> translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
> without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
> "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
> this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
> not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
> constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
> running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
> you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
> disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
> and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
> Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
> at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
> forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
> or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
> these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
>     that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
>     in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
>     licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
>     this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
>     you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
>     most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
>     appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
>     else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
>     the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
>     of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
>     not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
>     not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
> sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
> considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
> its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
> works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
> work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
> of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
> rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
> right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
> the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
> Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
> distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
> License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
> Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
> 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
>     code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
>     on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
>     give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
>     performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
>     corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
>     for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
>     object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
>     Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
> modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all

> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
> expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,

> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
> However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
> or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not

> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),

> copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
> You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
> rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
> third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
> are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
> contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
> conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
> simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
> obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
> For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
> of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
> you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
> refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any

> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
> other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
> section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
> distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
> people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
> distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
> system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
> distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
> choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
> consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
> countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
> copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
> geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
> distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
> such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
> of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
> General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
> spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
> or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
> version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
> that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
> If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
> choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
> whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
> permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,
> write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.
> Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
> all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of
> software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
> THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE

> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible

> which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
> them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
> of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a

>     and that Source Code form must be distributed only under the terms
>     of this License. You must include a copy of this License with every

> 
>     The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are

> 
>     You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that

>     Initial Developer.
> 
>     3.4. Application of Additional Terms.
> 
>     You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
>     Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version of
>     this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may choose to
>     offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
>     However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of
>     the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
>     absolutely clear that any such warranty, support, indemnity or
>     liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
>     to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
>     liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
>     result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.
> 
>     3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.
> 
>     You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software under
>     the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of Your
>     choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
>     provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
>     and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
>     limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
>     the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the Covered
>     Software in Executable form under a different license, You must make
>     it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License
>     are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
>     Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and
>     every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
>     Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
> 
>     3.6. Larger Works.
> 
>     You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
>     other code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute
>     the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
>     sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered
>     Software.
> 
> 4. Versions of the License.
> 
>     4.1. New Versions.
> 
>     Oracle is the initial license steward and may publish revised and/or
>     new versions of this License from time to time. Each version will be
>     given a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section
>     4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify
>     this License.
> 
>     4.2. Effect of New Versions.
> 
>     You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
>     Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
>     License under which You originally received the Covered Software. If
>     the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original Software
>     prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made available
>     under any subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and
>     make the Covered Software available under the terms of the version
>     of the License under which You originally received the Covered
>     Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
>     otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms of any
>     subsequent version of the License published by the license steward.
> 
>     4.3. Modified Versions.
> 
>     When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
>     license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
>     modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license and
>     remove any references to the name of the license steward (except to
>     note that the license differs from this License); and (b) otherwise
>     make it clear that the license contains terms which differ from this
>     License.
> 
> 5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
> 
>     COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
>     WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
>     INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
>     IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
>     NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
>     THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
>     DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
>     OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
>     REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
>     ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
>     AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
> 
> 6. TERMINATION.
> 
>     6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
>     automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
>     cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
>     Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
>     termination of this License shall survive.
> 
>     6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
>     declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
>     Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
>     assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that the
>     Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where the
>     Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where the
>     Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
>     indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the
>     Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors under
>     Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
>     from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically at the
>     expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60
>     day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the Participant
>     Software against such Participant either unilaterally or pursuant to
>     a written agreement with Participant.
> 
>     6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
>     alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
>     infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
>     license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
>     infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
>     granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be taken
>     into account in determining the amount or value of any payment or
>     license.
> 
>     6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
>     all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
>     distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
>     granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.
> 
> 7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
> 
>     UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
>     (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
>     INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
>     COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
>     TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
>     CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
>     LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
>     FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
>     LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
>     POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
>     APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
>     PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
>     LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
>     LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
>     AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

> Preamble
> 
> The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
> share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
> intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
> make sure the software is free for all its users. This General Public
> License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
> to any other program whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free
> Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
> Public License instead.) You can apply it to your programs, too.
> 
> When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
> Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
> freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
> service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
> 
> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
> to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
> restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
> distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
> 
> For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
> or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
> You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
> And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
> 
> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
> (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
> distribute and/or modify the software.
> 
> Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
> that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
> software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
> want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
> that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
> authors' reputations.
> 
> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
> individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
> proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must
> be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
> 
> The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.
> 
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
> 
> 0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
> notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under
> the terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers
> to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means
> either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is
> to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either
> verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language.
> (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
> "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as "you".
> 
> Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
> covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running
> the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is
> covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Program
> (independent of having been made by running the Program). Whether that
> is true depends on what the Program does.
> 
> 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
> code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
> and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
> and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
> this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
> recipients of the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
> You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
> you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
> 
> 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
> it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute
> such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
> that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
>     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
> 
>     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
>     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part
>     thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
>     under the terms of this License.
> 
>     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
>     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
>     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
>     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a notice
>     that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide a
>     warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
>     conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
>     (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not
>     normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program
>     is not required to print an announcement.)
> 
> These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If
> identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
> can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
> themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
> sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you
> distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
> the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
> License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
> whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
> 
> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
> your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
> exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
> collective works based on the Program.
> 
> In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
> with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
> storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
> scope of this License.
> 
> 3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
> under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
> Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
> 
>     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
>     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
>     and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
>     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost
>     of physically performing source distribution, a complete
>     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
>     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
>     customarily used for software interchange; or,
> 
>     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
>     distribute corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed
>     only for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the
>     program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
>     accord with Subsection b above.)
> 
> The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
> making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code
> means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
> associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
> compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a special
> exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is
> normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
> components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
> which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
> executable.
> 
> If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
> to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy
> the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source
> code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source
> along with the object code.
> 
> 4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
> except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise
> to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will
> automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties
> who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will
> not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in
> full compliance.
> 
> 5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
> signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
> distribute the Program or its derivative works. These actions are
> prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
> modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all
> its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
> Program or works based on it.
> 
> 6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
> Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
> original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
> these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions
> on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
> responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License.
> 
> 7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
> infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
> conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute
> so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
> any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
> distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent license would
> not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
> receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
> could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
> distribution of the Program.
> 
> If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
> any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
> apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
> circumstances.
> 
> It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
> patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
> such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
> integrity of the free software distribution system, which is implemented
> by public license practices. Many people have made generous
> contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that
> system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to
> the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute
> software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
> 
> This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
> a consequence of the rest of this License.
> 
> 8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
> certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
> original copyright holder who places the Program under this License may
> add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
> countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
> not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the
> limitation as if written in the body of this License.
> 
> 9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
> versions of the General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
> Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
> specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
> later version", you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
> the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version
> number of this License, you may choose any version ever published by the
> Free Software Foundation.
> 
> 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
> programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
> author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
> Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we
> sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the
> two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
> software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
> 
> NO WARRANTY
> 
> 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
> WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
> EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
> OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
> EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
> WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE
> ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH
> YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL
> NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
> 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
> WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
> AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
> DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
> DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM
> (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
> INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
> THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
> OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
> END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
> 
> How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
> 
> If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
> possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
> free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
> 
> To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
> attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
> the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
> "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
> 
>     One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.
>     Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

> Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

> 
> Statement of Purpose
> 
> The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
> exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
> and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
> authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
> 
> Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
> the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
> scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
> of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
> works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
> and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
> These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
> culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
> works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
> part through the use and efforts of others.
> 
> For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
> expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
> associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
> is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
> elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
> terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
> Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
> 
> 1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
> protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
> Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
> limited to, the following:
> 
>   i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
>      communicate, and translate a Work;
>  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
> iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
>      likeness depicted in a Work;
>  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
>      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
>   v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
>      in a Work;
>  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
>      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
>      protection of databases, and under any national implementation
>      thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
>      directive); and
> vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
>      world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
>      implementations thereof.
> 
> 2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
> of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
> irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
> Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
> of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
> future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
> worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
> treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
> medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
> including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
> purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
> member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
> successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
> revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
> equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
> as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
> 
> 3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
> be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
> Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
> account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
> extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
> person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
> irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
> Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
> maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
> time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
> of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
> limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
> "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
> applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
> reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
> partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
> of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
> will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
> Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
> action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
> express Statement of Purpose.
> 
> 4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
> 
>  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
>     surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
>  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
>     warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
>     statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
>     title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
>     infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
>     the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
>     the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
>  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
>     that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
>     limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
>     Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
>     consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
>     Work.
>  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
>     party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
>     this CC0 or use of the Work.

>           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
>           the Derivative Works; and
> 
>       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
>           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
>           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
>           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
>           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
>           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
>           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or

>           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
>           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
>           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
>           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
>           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
>           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
>           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
>           as modifying the License.
> 
>       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
>       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
>       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

>       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
>       the conditions stated in this License.
> 
>    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
>       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

>       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
>       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
> 
>    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
>       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
>       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
>       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
> 
>    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or

>       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
>       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
>       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
>       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
>       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
>       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
>       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
>       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
>       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
> 
>    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
>       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
>       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
>       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
>       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
>       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
>       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
>       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
>       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
>       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
> 
>    END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## agent-base@4.2.1

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-agent-base
* **Publisher:** Nathan Rajlich ( nathan@tootallnate.net )
* **Description:** Turn a function into an `http.Agent` instance
* **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;

> agent-base
> ==========
> ### Turn a function into an [`http.Agent`][http.Agent] instance
> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-agent-base)
> 
> This module provides an `http.Agent` generator. That is, you pass it an async
> callback function, and it returns a new `http.Agent` instance that will invoke the
> given callback function when sending outbound HTTP requests.
> 
> #### Some subclasses:
> 
> Here's some more interesting uses of `agent-base`.
> Send a pull request to list yours!
> 
>  * [`http-proxy-agent`][http-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP endpoints
>  * [`https-proxy-agent`][https-proxy-agent]: An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS endpoints
>  * [`pac-proxy-agent`][pac-proxy-agent]: A PAC file proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
>  * [`socks-proxy-agent`][socks-proxy-agent]: A SOCKS (v4a) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTP and HTTPS
> 
> 
> Installation
> ------------
> 
> Install with `npm`:
> 
> ``` bash
> $ npm install agent-base
> ```
> 
> 
> Example
> -------
> 
> Here's a minimal example that creates a new `net.Socket` connection to the server
> for every HTTP request (i.e. the equivalent of `agent: false` option):
> 
> ```js
> var net = require('net');
> var tls = require('tls');
> var url = require('url');
> var http = require('http');
> var agent = require('agent-base');
> 
> var endpoint = 'http://nodejs.org/api/';
> var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
> 
> // This is the important part!
> parsed.agent = agent(function (req, opts) {
>   var socket;
>   // `secureEndpoint` is true when using the https module
>   if (opts.secureEndpoint) {
>     socket = tls.connect(opts);
>   } else {
>     socket = net.connect(opts);
>   }
>   return socket;
> });
> 
> // Everything else works just like normal...
> http.get(parsed, function (res) {
>   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
>   res.pipe(process.stdout);
> });
> ```
> 
> Returning a Promise or using an `async` function is also supported:
> 
> ```js
> agent(async function (req, opts) {
>   await sleep(1000);
>   // etc…
> });
> ```
> 
> Return another `http.Agent` instance to "pass through" the responsibility
> for that HTTP request to that agent:
> 
> ```js
> agent(function (req, opts) {
>   return opts.secureEndpoint ? https.globalAgent : http.globalAgent;
> });
> ```
> 
> 
> API
> ---
> 
> ## Agent(Function callback[, Object options]) → [http.Agent][]
> 
> Creates a base `http.Agent` that will execute the callback function `callback`
> for every HTTP request that it is used as the `agent` for. The callback function
> is responsible for creating a `stream.Duplex` instance of some kind that will be
> used as the underlying socket in the HTTP request.
> 
> The `options` object accepts the following properties:
> 
>   * `timeout` - Number - Timeout for the `callback()` function in milliseconds. Defaults to Infinity (optional).
> 
> The callback function should have the following signature:
> 
> ### callback(http.ClientRequest req, Object options, Function cb) → undefined
> 
> The ClientRequest `req` can be accessed to read request headers and
> and the path, etc. The `options` object contains the options passed
> to the `http.request()`/`https.request()` function call, and is formatted
> to be directly passed to `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()`, or however
> else you want a Socket to be created. Pass the created socket to
> the callback function `cb` once created, and the HTTP request will
> continue to proceed.
> 
> If the `https` module is used to invoke the HTTP request, then the
> `secureEndpoint` property on `options` _will be set to `true`_.

* **Copyright:** Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2013.

> # ASN1.js
> 
> ASN.1 DER Encoder/Decoder and DSL.
> 
> ## Example
> 
> Define model:
> 
> ```javascript
> var asn = require('asn1.js');
> 
> var Human = asn.define('Human', function() {
>   this.seq().obj(
>     this.key('firstName').octstr(),

>   this.seq().obj(
>     this.key('time').gentime(),
>     this.key('description').octstr()
>   );
> });
> ```
> 
> Encode data:
> 
> ```javascript
> var output = Human.encode({
>   firstName: 'Thomas',
>   lastName: 'Anderson',
>   age: 28,
>   gender: 'male',
>   bio: [
>     {
>       time: +new Date('31 March 1999'),
>       description: 'freedom of mind'
>     }
>   ]
> }, 'der');
> ```
> 
> Decode data:
> 
> ```javascript
> var human = Human.decode(output, 'der');
> console.log(human);
> /*
> { firstName: <Buffer 54 68 6f 6d 61 73>,
>   lastName: <Buffer 41 6e 64 65 72 73 6f 6e>,

> 
> ### Partial decode
> 
> Its possible to parse data without stopping on first error. In order to do it,

## assert-plus@1.0.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/mcavage/node-assert-plus
* **Publisher:** Mark Cavage ( mcavage@gmail.com )
* **Description:** Extra assertions on top of node's assert module
> # assert-plus
> 
> This library is a super small wrapper over node's assert module that has two
> things: (1) the ability to disable assertions with the environment variable
> NODE\_NDEBUG, and (2) some API wrappers for argument testing.  Like
> `assert.string(myArg, 'myArg')`.  As a simple example, most of my code looks
> like this:
> 
> ```javascript
>     var assert = require('assert-plus');
> 
>     function fooAccount(options, callback) {
>         assert.object(options, 'options');
>         assert.number(options.id, 'options.id');
>         assert.bool(options.isManager, 'options.isManager');
>         assert.string(options.name, 'options.name');
>         assert.arrayOfString(options.email, 'options.email');
>         assert.func(callback, 'callback');
> 
>         // Do stuff
>         callback(null, {});
>     }
> ```
> 
> # API
> 
> All methods that *aren't* part of node's core assert API are simply assumed to
> take an argument, and then a string 'name' that's not a message; `AssertionError`
> will be thrown if the assertion fails with a message like:
> 
>     AssertionError: foo (string) is required
>     at test (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:3:9)
>     at Object.<anonymous> (/home/mark/work/foo/foo.js:15:1)
>     at Module._compile (module.js:446:26)
>     at Object..js (module.js:464:10)
>     at Module.load (module.js:353:31)
>     at Function._load (module.js:311:12)
>     at Array.0 (module.js:484:10)
>     at EventEmitter._tickCallback (node.js:190:38)
> 
> from:
> 
> ```javascript
>     function test(foo) {
>         assert.string(foo, 'foo');
>     }
> ```
> 
> There you go.  You can check that arrays are of a homogeneous type with `Arrayof$Type`:
> 
> ```javascript
>     function test(foo) {
>         assert.arrayOfString(foo, 'foo');
>     }
> ```
> 
> You can assert IFF an argument is not `undefined` (i.e., an optional arg):
> 
> ```javascript
>     assert.optionalString(foo, 'foo');
> ```
> 
> Lastly, you can opt-out of assertion checking altogether by setting the
> environment variable `NODE_NDEBUG=1`.  This is pseudo-useful if you have
> lots of assertions, and don't want to pay `typeof ()` taxes to v8 in
> production.  Be advised:  The standard functions re-exported from `assert` are
> also disabled in assert-plus if NDEBUG is specified.  Using them directly from
> the `assert` module avoids this behavior.
> 
> The complete list of APIs is:
> 
> * assert.array
> * assert.bool
> * assert.buffer
> * assert.func
> * assert.number
> * assert.finite
> * assert.object
> * assert.string
> * assert.stream

> | `ast`                    | `true`               | Include the AST in the returned object |
> | `auxiliaryCommentAfter`  | `null`               | Attach a comment after all non-user injected code. |
> | `auxiliaryCommentBefore` | `null`               | Attach a comment before all non-user injected code. |
> | `babelrc`                | `true`               | Specify whether or not to use .babelrc and .babelignore files. Not available when using the CLI, [use `--no-babelrc` instead](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-cli#ignoring-babelrc). |
> | `code`                   | `true`               | Enable code generation |
> | `comments`               | `true`               | Output comments in generated output. |
> | `compact`                | `"auto"`             | Do not include superfluous whitespace characters and line terminators. When set to `"auto"` compact is set to `true` on input sizes of >500KB. |
> | `env`                    | `{}`                 | This is an object of keys that represent different environments. For example, you may have: `{ env: { production: { /* specific options */ } } }` which will use those options when the environment variable `BABEL_ENV` is set to `"production"`. If `BABEL_ENV` isn't set then `NODE_ENV` will be used, if it's not set then it defaults to `"development"` |
> | `extends`                | `null`               | A path to an `.babelrc` file to extend |
> | `filename`               | `"unknown"`          | Filename for use in errors etc. |

> | `getModuleId`            | `null`               | Specify a custom callback to generate a module id with. Called as `getModuleId(moduleName)`. If falsy value is returned then the generated module id is used. |
> | `highlightCode`          | `true`               | ANSI highlight syntax error code frames |
> | `ignore`                 | `null`               | Opposite to the `only` option. `ignore` is disregarded if `only` is specified. |
> | `inputSourceMap`         | `null`               | A source map object that the output source map will be based on. |
> | `minified`               | `false`              | Should the output be minified (not printing last semicolons in blocks, printing literal string values instead of escaped ones, stripping `()` from `new` when safe) |
> | `moduleId`               | `null`               | Specify a custom name for module ids. |
> | `moduleIds`              | `false`              | If truthy, insert an explicit id for modules. By default, all modules are anonymous. (Not available for `common` modules) |

> | `only`                   | `null`               | A [glob](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch), regex, or mixed array of both, matching paths to **only** compile. Can also be an array of arrays containing paths to explicitly match. When attempting to compile a non-matching file it's returned verbatim. |
> | `parserOpts`             | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel parser, babylon |
> | `plugins`                | `[]`                 | List of [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins) to load and use. |
> | `presets`                | `[]`                 | List of [presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#presets) (a set of plugins) to load and use. |
> | `retainLines`            | `false`              | Retain line numbers. This will lead to wacky code but is handy for scenarios where you can't use source maps. (**NOTE:** This will not retain the columns) |
> | `resolveModuleSource`    | `null`               | Resolve a module source ie. `import "SOURCE";` to a custom value. Called as `resolveModuleSource(source, filename)`. |
> | `shouldPrintComment`     | `null`               | An optional callback that controls whether a comment should be output or not. Called as `shouldPrintComment(commentContents)`. **NOTE:** This overrides the `comment` option when used. |
> | `sourceFileName`         | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `sources[0]` on returned source map. |
> | `sourceMaps`             | `false`              | If truthy, adds a `map` property to returned output. If set to `"inline"`, a comment with a sourceMappingURL directive is added to the bottom of the returned code. If set to `"both"` then a `map` property is returned as well as a source map comment appended. **This does not emit sourcemap files by itself!** To have sourcemaps emitted using the CLI, you must pass it the `--source-maps` option. |
> | `sourceMapTarget`        | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `file` on returned source map. |
> | `sourceRoot`             | `(moduleRoot)`       | The root from which all sources are relative. |
> | `sourceType`             | `"module"`           | Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either "script" or "module". |
> | `wrapPluginVisitorMethod`| `null`               | An optional callback that can be used to wrap visitor methods. **NOTE:** This is useful for things like introspection, and not really needed for implementing anything. Called as `wrapPluginVisitorMethod(pluginAlias, visitorType, callback)`.

> ## AST from Multiple Sources
> 
> In most cases, Babel does a 1:1 transformation of input-file to output-file.  However,
> you may be dealing with AST constructed from multiple sources - JS files, templates, etc.
> If this is the case, and you want the sourcemaps to reflect the correct sources, you'll need
> to pass an object to `generate` as the `code` parameter.  Keys
> should be the source filenames, and values should be the source content.
> 
> Here's an example of what that might look like:
> 
> ```js
> import {parse} from 'babylon';
> import generate from 'babel-generator';
> 
> const a = 'var a = 1;';
> const b = 'var b = 2;';
> const astA = parse(a, { sourceFilename: 'a.js' });
> const astB = parse(b, { sourceFilename: 'b.js' });
> const ast = {
>   type: 'Program',
>   body: [].concat(astA.program.body, astB.program.body)
> };
> 
> const { code, map } = generate(ast, { sourceMaps: true }, {
>   'a.js': a,
>   'b.js': b
> });
> 
> // Sourcemap will point to both a.js and b.js where appropriate.

## babel-register@6.26.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages/babel-register
* **Publisher:** Sebastian McKenzie ( sebmck@gmail.com )
* **Description:** babel require hook
> # babel-register
> 
> > The require hook will bind itself to node's require and automatically compile files on the fly.
> 
> One of the ways you can use Babel is through the require hook. The require hook
> will bind itself to node's `require` and automatically compile files on the
> fly. This is equivalent to CoffeeScript's
> [coffee-script/register](http://coffeescript.org/v2/annotated-source/register.html).
> 
> ## Install
> 
> ```sh
> npm install babel-register --save-dev
> ```
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ```js
> require("babel-register");
> ```
> 
> All subsequent files required by node with the extensions `.es6`, `.es`, `.jsx`
> and `.js` will be transformed by Babel.
> 
> <blockquote class="babel-callout babel-callout-info">
>   <h4>Polyfill not included</h4>
>   <p>
>     You must include the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/">polyfill</a> separately
>     when using features that require it, like generators.
>   </p>
> </blockquote>
> 
> ### Ignores `node_modules` by default
> 
> **NOTE:** By default all requires to `node_modules` will be ignored. You can
> override this by passing an ignore regex via:
> 
> ```js
> require("babel-register")({
>   // This will override `node_modules` ignoring - you can alternatively pass
>   // an array of strings to be explicitly matched or a regex / glob
>   ignore: false
> });
> ```
> 
> ## Specifying options
> 
> ```javascript
> require("babel-register")({
>   // Optional ignore regex - if any filenames **do** match this regex then they
>   // aren't compiled.
>   ignore: /regex/,
> 
>   // Ignore can also be specified as a function.
>   ignore: function(filename) {
>     if (filename === "/path/to/es6-file.js") {
>       return false;
>     } else {
>       return true;
>     }
>   },
> 
>   // Optional only regex - if any filenames **don't** match this regex then they
>   // aren't compiled
>   only: /my_es6_folder/,
> 
>   // Setting this will remove the currently hooked extensions of .es6, `.es`, `.jsx`
>   // and .js so you'll have to add them back if you want them to be used again.
>   extensions: [".es6", ".es", ".jsx", ".js"],
> 
>   // Setting this to false will disable the cache.
>   cache: true
> });
> ```
> 
> You can pass in all other [options](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/#options) as well,
> including `plugins` and `presets`. But note that the closest [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/)
> to each file still applies, and takes precedence over any options you pass in here.
> 
> ## Environment variables
> 
> By default `babel-node` and `babel-register` will save to a json cache in your
> temporary directory.
> 
> This will heavily improve with the startup and compilation of your files. There
> are however scenarios where you want to change this behaviour and there are
> environment variables exposed to allow you to do this.
> 
> ### BABEL_CACHE_PATH
> 
> Specify a different cache location.
> 
> ```sh
> BABEL_CACHE_PATH=/foo/my-cache.json babel-node script.js
> ```
> 
> ### BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE
> 
> Disable the cache.
> 
> ```sh
> BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 babel-node script.js
> ```

* **Publisher:** Fedor Indutny ( fedor@indutny.com )
* **Description:** Big number implementation in pure javascript
* **Copyright:** Copyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.

> > BigNum in pure javascript
> 
> [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/indutny/bn.js)
> 
> ## Install
> `npm install --save bn.js`
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ```js
> const BN = require('bn.js');
> 
> var a = new BN('dead', 16);
> var b = new BN('101010', 2);
>

> ```
> 
> **Note**: decimals are not supported in this library.
> 
> ## Notation
> 
> ### Prefixes
> 
> There are several prefixes to instructions that affect the way the work. Here
> is the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:
> 
> * `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on
>   which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs
> * `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or
>   always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations
>   like `mod()`. In such cases if the result will be negative - modulo will be
>   added to the result to make it positive
> 
> ### Postfixes
> 
> The only available postfix at the moment is:
> 
> * `n` - which means that the argument of the function must be a plain JavaScript
>   Number. Decimals are not supported.
> 
> ### Examples
> 
> * `a.iadd(b)` - perform addition on `a` and `b`, storing the result in `a`
> * `a.umod(b)` - reduce `a` modulo `b`, returning positive value
> * `a.iushln(13)` - shift bits of `a` left by 13
> 
> ## Instructions
> 
> Prefixes/postfixes are put in parens at the of the line. `endian` - could be
> either `le` (little-endian) or `be` (big-endian).
> 
> ### Utilities
> 
> * `a.clone()` - clone number
> * `a.toString(base, length)` - convert to base-string and pad with zeroes
> * `a.toNumber()` - convert to Javascript Number (limited to 53 bits)
> * `a.toJSON()` - convert to JSON compatible hex string (alias of `toString(16)`)
> * `a.toArray(endian, length)` - convert to byte `Array`, and optionally zero
>   pad to length, throwing if already exceeding
> * `a.toArrayLike(type, endian, length)` - convert to an instance of `type`,
>   which must behave like an `Array`
> * `a.toBuffer(endian, length)` - convert to Node.js Buffer (if available). For
>   compatibility with browserify and similar tools, use this instead:
>   `a.toArrayLike(Buffer, endian, length)`
> * `a.bitLength()` - get number of bits occupied
> * `a.zeroBits()` - return number of less-significant consequent zero bits
>   (example: `1010000` has 4 zero bits)
> * `a.byteLength()` - return number of bytes occupied
> * `a.isNeg()` - true if the number is negative
> * `a.isEven()` - no comments
> * `a.isOdd()` - no comments
> * `a.isZero()` - no comments
> * `a.cmp(b)` - compare numbers and return `-1` (a `<` b), `0` (a `==` b), or `1` (a `>` b)
>   depending on the comparison result (`ucmp`, `cmpn`)
> * `a.lt(b)` - `a` less than `b` (`n`)
> * `a.lte(b)` - `a` less than or equals `b` (`n`)
> * `a.gt(b)` - `a` greater than `b` (`n`)
> * `a.gte(b)` - `a` greater than or equals `b` (`n`)
> * `a.eq(b)` - `a` equals `b` (`n`)
> * `a.toTwos(width)` - convert to two's complement representation, where `width` is bit width
> * `a.fromTwos(width)` - convert from two's complement representation, where `width` is the bit width
> * `BN.isBN(object)` - returns true if the supplied `object` is a BN.js instance
> 
> ### Arithmetics
> 
> * `a.neg()` - negate sign (`i`)
> * `a.abs()` - absolute value (`i`)
> * `a.add(b)` - addition (`i`, `n`, `in`)
> * `a.sub(b)` - subtraction (`i`, `n`, `in`)
> * `a.mul(b)` - multiply (`i`, `n`, `in`)
> * `a.sqr()` - square (`i`)
> * `a.pow(b)` - raise `a` to the power of `b`
> * `a.div(b)` - divide (`divn`, `idivn`)
> * `a.mod(b)` - reduct (`u`, `n`) (but no `umodn`)
> * `a.divRound(b)` - rounded division
> 
> ### Bit operations
> 
> * `a.or(b)` - or (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
> * `a.and(b)` - and (`i`, `u`, `iu`, `andln`) (NOTE: `andln` is going to be replaced
>   with `andn` in future)
> * `a.xor(b)` - xor (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
> * `a.setn(b)` - set specified bit to `1`
> * `a.shln(b)` - shift left (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
> * `a.shrn(b)` - shift right (`i`, `u`, `iu`)
> * `a.testn(b)` - test if specified bit is set
> * `a.maskn(b)` - clear bits with indexes higher or equal to `b` (`i`)
> * `a.bincn(b)` - add `1 << b` to the number
> * `a.notn(w)` - not (for the width specified by `w`) (`i`)
> 
> ### Reduction
> 
> * `a.gcd(b)` - GCD
> * `a.egcd(b)` - Extended GCD results (`{ a: ..., b: ..., gcd: ... }`)
> * `a.invm(b)` - inverse `a` modulo `b`
> 
> ## Fast reduction
> 
> When doing lots of reductions using the same modulo, it might be beneficial to
> use some tricks: like [Montgomery multiplication][0], or using special algorithm
> for [Mersenne Prime][1].
> 
> ### Reduction context
> 
> To enable this tricks one should create a reduction context:
> 
> ```js
> var red = BN.red(num);
> ```
> where `num` is just a BN instance.
> 
> Or:
> 
> ```js
> var red = BN.red(primeName);
> ```
> 
> Where `primeName` is either of these [Mersenne Primes][1]:
> 
> * `'k256'`
> * `'p224'`
> * `'p192'`
> * `'p25519'`
> 
> Or:
> 
> ```js
> var red = BN.mont(num);
> ```
> 
> To reduce numbers with [Montgomery trick][0]. `.mont()` is generally faster than
> `.red(num)`, but slower than `BN.red(primeName)`.
> 
> ### Converting numbers
> 
> Before performing anything in reduction context - numbers should be converted
> to it. Usually, this means that one should:
> 
> * Convert inputs to reducted ones
> * Operate on them in reduction context
> * Convert outputs back from the reduction context
> 
> Here is how one may convert numbers to `red`:
> 
> ```js
> var redA = a.toRed(red);
> ```
> Where `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above
> 
> Here is how to convert them back:
> 
> ```js
> var a = redA.fromRed();
> ```
> 
> ### Red instructions
> 
> Most of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their
> counterparts in red context:
> 
> * `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`
> * `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`
> * `a.redShl(num)`
> * `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`
> * `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`
> * `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime
> * `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number
> * `a.redNeg()`
> * `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation

## boolbase@1.0.0

* **License(s):** ISC
* **Repository:** https://github.com/fb55/boolbase
* **Publisher:** Felix Boehm ( me@feedic.com )
* **Description:** two functions: One that returns true, one that returns false
> #boolbase
> This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).
> 
> ###WTF?
> 
> By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.
> 
> ###And why is this a separate module?
> 
> I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

> ... each one is a full, working example - just have a look at the `readme.md` in each one for installation

> 
> 
> ### Contributions / Feedback
> 
> Spotted an error? Couldn't get one of the examples running? Have your own sweet setup that you want to show off to the world?
> We'd love to receive your feedback and contributions - so please get in touch! We aim to make this project the canonical source 
> of example projects & code snippets related to running Browsersync.
> 
> ### How to contribute an example
> 
> First thing you should do, is take a look at our [simplest example here](https://github.com/Browsersync/recipes/tree/master/recipes/server) - 
> this will give you a great head-start on setting up your code.
> 
> Then, `fork` this repo and `clone` your fork down to your local machine. Now create a new folder inside `recipes`
> (note the naming structure). This is where you create your awesome example. You're free to do as you like,
> but there are a couple of rules you'll need to follow to ensure the project can build.
> 
> **Required Files**
> 
> - `package.json` (see below for requirements)
> - `app.js` (or any JS file showing the example)
> - `./app` directory. Always include the minimum HTML, JS & CSS needed to prove your example.
> 
> **Do NOT include**
> - `readme.md` (this is created dynamically for you)
> - any other files that are not related to your example.
> 
> 
> ### package.json requirements
> 
> 
> **start command**: For consistency, ensure your example can be run with the command `npm start`. To 
> do this, you just need to provide something along these lines:
> 
> ```json
> "scripts": {
>     "start": "node app.js"
> },
> ```
> 
> **main file**: We inline your main Javascript file into the `readme.md`, so
> don't miss this field.
> 
> ```json
> "main": "app.js" // or gulpfile.js etc
> ```
> 
> **description**: We use this as the Title. So make it short and descriptive, such as 
> 
> ```json
> "description": "Server example"
> ```
> 
> ### Finally, build.
> After you've added your example in the recipes folder, return to the root and run
> 
> ```bash
> npm install && npm run build
> ```
> 
> This will install [Crossbow.js](https://github.com/shakyShane/crossbow.js) and compile the project.
> Commit everything that has changed and push it up to your fork. Send a Pull Request when you're
> ready, or if you'd like us to have a look over your code before that, just ping us [twitter](https://twitter.com/browsersync) and we'll 
> take a look!

## bser@2.0.0

* **License(s):** Apache-2.0
* **Repository:** https://github.com/facebook/watchman
* **Publisher:** Wez Furlong ( wez@fb.com )
* **Description:** JavaScript implementation of the BSER Binary Serialization
> # BSER Binary Serialization
> 
> BSER is a binary serialization scheme that can be used as an alternative to JSON.
> BSER uses a framed encoding that makes it simpler to use to stream a sequence of
> encoded values.
> 
> It is intended to be used for local-IPC only and strings are represented as binary
> with no specific encoding; this matches the convention employed by most operating
> system filename storage.
> 
> For more details about the serialization scheme see
> [Watchman's docs](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/bser.html).
> 
> ## API
> 
> ```js
> var bser = require('bser');
> ```
> 
> ### bser.loadFromBuffer
> 
> The is the synchronous decoder; given an input string or buffer,
> decodes a single value and returns it.  Throws an error if the
> input is invalid.
> 
> ```js
> var obj = bser.loadFromBuffer(buf);
> ```
> 
> ### bser.dumpToBuffer
> 
> Synchronously encodes a value as BSER.
> 
> ```js
> var encoded = bser.dumpToBuffer(['hello']);
> console.log(bser.loadFromBuffer(encoded)); // ['hello']
> ```
> 
> ### BunserBuf
> 
> The asynchronous decoder API is implemented in the BunserBuf object.
> You may incrementally append data to this object and it will emit the
> decoded values via its `value` event.
> 
> ```js
> var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();
> 
> bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
>   console.log(obj);
> });
> ```
> 
> Then in your socket `data` event:
> 
> ```js
> bunser.append(buf);
> ```
> 
> ## Example
> 
> Read BSER from socket:
> 
> ```js
> var bunser = new bser.BunserBuf();
> 
> bunser.on('value', function(obj) {
>   console.log('data from socket', obj);
> });
> 
> var socket = net.connect('/socket');
> 
> socket.on('data', function(buf) {
>   bunser.append(buf);
> });
> ```
> 
> Write BSER to socket:
> 
> ```js
> socket.write(bser.dumpToBuffer(obj));
> ```

> 
> > A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.
> 
> [![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)
> 
> ## Why?
> Node.js `fs.watch`:
> 
> * Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
> * Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
> * Often reports events twice.
> * Emits most changes as `rename`.
> * Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
> * Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.
> 
> Node.js `fs.watchFile`:
> 
> * Almost as bad at event handling.
> * Also does not provide any recursive watching.
> * Results in high CPU utilization.
> 
> Chokidar resolves these problems.
> 
> Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
> [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
> [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
> [PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
> [browserify](http://browserify.org/),
> [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
> [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
> [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
> and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
> It has proven itself in production environments.
> 
> ## How?
> Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
> `fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
> receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.
> 
> On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
> `FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
> implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
> does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.
> 
> On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
> avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
> watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
> specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
> more than needed.
> 
> ## Getting started
> Install with npm:
> 
> ```sh
> npm install chokidar
> ```
> 
> Then `require` and use it in your code:
> 
> ```javascript
> var chokidar = require('chokidar');
> 
> // One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
> chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {
>   console.log(event, path);
> });
> ```
> 
> ```javascript
> // Example of a more typical implementation structure:
> 
> // Initialize watcher.
> var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
>   ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
>   persistent: true
> });
> 
> // Something to use when events are received.
> var log = console.log.bind(console);
> // Add event listeners.
> watcher
>   .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
>   .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
>   .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));
> 
> // More possible events.
> watcher

> ## API
> 
> `chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`
> 
> * `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
> recursively, or glob patterns.
> * `options` (object) Options object as defined below:
> 
> #### Persistence
> 
> * `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
> should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
> `false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
> after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.
> 
> #### Path filtering
> 
> * `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
> Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
> tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
> gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
> time with two arguments (the path and the
> [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
> object of that path).
> * `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
> instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
> * `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
> symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
> the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
> * `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
> derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
> * `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
> literal path names, even if they look like globs.
> 
> #### Performance
> 
> * `usePolling` (default: `false`).
> Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
> leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
> typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
> a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
> non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
> `useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
> to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
> * _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
>   * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also
>     set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
>   * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
>   polling for binary files.
>   ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
> * `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
> `fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
> and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
> set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
> * `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
> [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
> object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
> this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
> already available from the underlying watch events.
> * `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
> subdirectories will be traversed.
> * `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
> By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
> the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
> events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
> especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
> write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
> Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
> holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
> configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
> dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
> be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
> Use with caution.
>   * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
>   timing params:*
>   * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
>   milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
>   * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.
> 
> #### Errors
> * `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
> that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
> or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
> * `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
> Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
> "atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
> re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
> rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
> for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
> milliseconds.
> 
> ### Methods & Events
> 
> `chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:
> 
> * `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
> Takes an array of strings or just one string.
> * `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
> Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
> `raw`, `error`.
> Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
> name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
> * `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
> Takes an array of strings or just one string.
> * `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
> * `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
> system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
> directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
> values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.
> 
> ## CLI
> 
> If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
> [chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
> execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.
> 
> ## Install Troubleshooting
> 
> * `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
>   * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
>     not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
>     Chokidar should function properly.
> 
> * `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
>   * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
>     `npm config set python python2.7`
> 
> * `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
>   * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

## cssstyle@1.2.2

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration
* **Description:** CSSStyleDeclaration Object Model implementation
> # CSSStyleDeclaration
> 
> [![NpmVersion](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/cssstyle.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cssstyle) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsakas/CSSStyleDeclaration)
> 
> CSSStyleDeclaration is a work-a-like to the CSSStyleDeclaration class in Nikita Vasilyev's [CSSOM](https://github.com/NV/CSSOM). I made it so that when using [jQuery in node](https://github.com/tmtk75/node-jquery) setting css attributes via $.fn.css() would work. node-jquery uses [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) to create a DOM to use in node. jsdom uses CSSOM for styling, and CSSOM's implementation of the [CSSStyleDeclaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSSStyleDeclaration) doesn't support [CSS2Properties](http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Style/css.html#CSS-CSS2Properties), which is how jQuery's [$.fn.css()](http://api.jquery.com/css/) operates.
> 
> ### Why not just issue a pull request?
> 
> Well, NV wants to keep CSSOM fast (which I can appreciate) and CSS2Properties aren't required by the standard (though every browser has the interface). So I figured the path of least resistance would be to just modify this one class, publish it as a node module (that requires CSSOM) and then make a pull request of jsdom to use it.
> 
> ### How do I test this code?
> 
> `npm test` should do the trick, assuming you have the dev dependencies installed:
> 
> ```
> $ npm test
> 
> tests
> ✔ Verify Has Properties
> ✔ Verify Has Functions
> ✔ Verify Has Special Properties
> ✔ Test From Style String
> ✔ Test From Properties
> ✔ Test Shorthand Properties
> ✔ Test width and height Properties and null and empty strings

## cyclist@0.2.2

* **License(s):** MIT*
* **Repository:** https://github.com/mafintosh/cyclist
* **Publisher:** Mathias Buus Madsen ( mathiasbuus@gmail.com )
* **Description:** Cyclist is an efficient cyclic list implemention.
> # Cyclist
> 
> Cyclist is an efficient [cyclic list](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer) implemention for Javascript.
> It is available through npm
> 
> 	npm install cyclist
> 
> ## What?
> 
> Cyclist allows you to create a list of fixed size that is cyclic.
> In a cyclist list the element following the last one is the first one.
> This property can be really useful when for example trying to order data
> packets that can arrive out of order over a network stream.
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ``` js
> var cyclist = require('cyclist');
> var list = cyclist(4); // if size (4) is not a power of 2 it will be the follwing power of 2
>                        // this buffer can now hold 4 elements in total
> 
> list.put(42, 'hello 42'); // store something and index 42
> list.put(43, 'hello 43'); // store something and index 43
> 
> console.log(list.get(42)); // prints hello 42
> console.log(list.get(46)); // prints hello 42 again since 46 - 42 == list.size
> ```
> 
> ## API
> 
> * `cyclist(size)` creates a new buffer
> * `cyclist#get(index)` get an object stored in the buffer
> * `cyclist#put(index,value)` insert an object into the buffer
> * `cyclist#del(index)` delete an object from an index
> * `cyclist#size` property containing current size of buffer

> console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
> console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
> ```
> 
> NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.
> 
> ## Supported curves
> 
> Elliptic.js support following curve types:
> 
> * Short Weierstrass
> * Montgomery
> * Edwards
> * Twisted Edwards
> 
> Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:
> 
> * `secp256k1`
> * `p192`
> * `p224`
> * `p256`
> * `p384`
> * `p521`
> * `curve25519`
> * `ed25519`
> 
> NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.
> 
> ### Implementation details
> 
> ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
> the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
> or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.
> 
> All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
> provided by [hash.js][2]
> 
> ### Related projects
> 
> * [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
>   browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
>   node)

> 
> Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.
> 
> **By errno:**
> 
> ```js
> require('errno').errno[3]
> // → {
> //     "errno": 3,
> //     "code": "EACCES",
> //     "description": "permission denied"
> //   }
> ```
> 
> **By code:**
> 
> ```js
> require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
> // → {
> //     "errno": 53,
> //     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
> //     "description": "directory not empty"
> //   }
> ```
> 
> **Make your errors more descriptive:**
> 
> ```js
> var errno = require('errno')
> 
> function errmsg(err) {
>   var str = 'Error: '
>   // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
>   if (errno.errno[err.errno])
>     str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
>   else
>     str += err.message
> 
>   // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
>   if (err.path)
>     str += ' [' + err.path + ']'
> 
>   return str
> }
> 
> var fs = require('fs')
> 
> fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
>   if (err)
>     console.log(errmsg(err))
> })
> ```
> 
> **Use as a command line tool:**
> 
> ```
> ~ $ errno 53
> {
>   "errno": 53,
>   "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
>   "description": "directory not empty"
> }
> ~ $ errno EROFS
> {
>   "errno": 56,
>   "code": "EROFS",
>   "description": "read-only file system"
> }
> ~ $ errno foo
> No such errno/code: "foo"
> ```
> 
> Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.
> 
> You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.
> 
> <a name="customerrors"></a>
> ## Custom errors
> 
> Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.
> 
> ```js
> var create = require('errno').custom.createError
> var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
> var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
> var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)
> 
> // use them!
> if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')
> 
> if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
> ```
> 
> Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:
> 
> ```js
> fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
>   if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
>   // do something else
> })
> ```
> 
> The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

> ### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)
> 
> Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
> [ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
> recursive traversing functionality.
> 
> ### Example Usage
> 
> The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.
> 
> ```javascript
> esrecurse.visit(ast, {
>     XXXStatement: function (node) {
>         this.visit(node.left);
>         // do something...
>         this.visit(node.right);
>     }
> });
> ```
> 
> We can use `Visitor` instance.
> 
> ```javascript
> var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
>     XXXStatement: function (node) {
>         this.visit(node.left);
>         // do something...
>         this.visit(node.right);
>     }
> });
> 
> visitor.visit(ast);
> ```
> 
> We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.
> 
> ```javascript
> class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
>     constructor()
>     {
>         super(null);
>     }
> 
>     XXXStatement(node) {
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> ```javascript
> function DerivedVisitor() {
>     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
> }
> util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
> DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
>     this.visit(node.left);
>     // do something...
>     this.visit(node.right);
> };
> ```
> 
> And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.
> 
> ```javascript
> function DerivedVisitor() {
>     esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
> }
> util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
> DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
>     // do something...
>     this.visitChildren(node);
> };
> ```
> 
> The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
> We can use user-defined node types.
> 
> ```javascript
> // This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
> var tree = {
>     type: 'TestExpression',
> 
>     // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
>     argument: {
>         type: 'Literal',
>         value: 20
>     },
> 
>     // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
>     extended: true
> };
> esrecurse.visit(
>     ast,
>     {
>         Literal: function (node) {
>             // do something...
>         }
>     },
>     {
>         // Extending the existing traversing rules.
>         childVisitorKeys: {
>             // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
>             TestExpression: ['argument']
>         }
>     }
> );
> ```
> 
> We can use the `fallback` option as well.
> If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
> Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).
> 
> ```javascript
> esrecurse.visit(
>     ast,
>     {
>         Literal: function (node) {
>             // do something...
>         }
>     },
>     {
>         fallback: 'iteration'
>     }
> );
> ```
> 
> If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
> Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).
> 
> ```javascript
> esrecurse.visit(
>     ast,
>     {
>         Literal: function (node) {
>             // do something...
>         }
>     },
>     {
>         fallback: function (node) {
>             return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
>                 return key !== 'argument'
>             });
>         }

## fb-watchman@2.0.0

* **License(s):** Apache-2.0
* **Repository:** https://github.com/facebook/watchman
* **Publisher:** Wez Furlong ( wez@fb.com )
* **Description:** Bindings for the Watchman file watching service
> # fb-watchman
> 
> `fb-watchman` is a filesystem watcher that uses the
> [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/) file watching service from
> Facebook.
> 
> Watchman provides file change notification services using very
> efficient recursive watches and also allows more advanced change matching and
> filesystem tree querying operations using
> [a powerful expression syntax](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/file-query.html#expressions).
> 
> ## Install
> 
> You should [install Watchman](
> https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html) to make the most of this
> module.
> 
> Then simply:
> 
> ```
> $ npm install fb-watchman
> ```
> 
> ## Key Concepts
> 
> - Watchman recursively watches directories.
> - Each watched directory is called a `root`.
> - You must initiate a `watch` on a `root` using the `watch-project` command prior to subscribing to changes
> - Rather than separately watching many sibling directories, `watch-project` consolidates and re-uses existing watches relative to a project root (the location of your `.watchmanconfig` or source control repository root)
> - change notifications are relative to the project root
> 
> ## How do I use it?
> 
> [Read the NodeJS watchman documentation](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/nodejs.html)

> growl('Set priority', { priority: 2 })
> growl('Show Safari icon', { image: 'Safari' })
> growl('Show icon', { image: 'path/to/icon.icns' })
> growl('Show image', { image: 'path/to/my.image.png' })
> growl('Show png filesystem icon', { image: 'png' })
> growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' })
> growl('Show pdf filesystem icon', { image: 'article.pdf' }, function(err){
>   // ... notified
> })
> ```
> 
> ## Options
> 
>   - title
>     - notification title
>   - name
>     - application name
>   - priority
>     - priority for the notification (default is 0)
>   - sticky
>     - weither or not the notification should remainin until closed

>       - path to an image sets --image
>       - capitalized word sets --appIcon
>       - filename uses extname as --icon
>       - otherwise treated as --icon
>   - exec
>     - manually specify a shell command instead
>       - appends message to end of shell command
>       - or, replaces `%s` with message
>       - optionally prepends title (example: `title: message`)
>       - examples: `{exec: 'tmux display-message'}`, `{exec: 'echo "%s" > messages.log}`

* **Publisher:** Ibrahim Al-Rajhi ( abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com )
* **Description:** Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.
* **Copyright:** Copyright (C) 2014 Ibrahim Al-Rajhi <abrahamalrajhi@gmail.com>

> # Growly #
> 
> Simple zero-dependency Growl notifications using GNTP.
> 
> ## Installation ##
> 
> Install growly using `npm`:
> 
> ```
> npm install growly
> ```
> 
> And then require it:
> 
> ```javascript
> var growly = require('growly');
> ```
> 
> This module uses the Growl Network Transport Protocol (GNTP) which was implemented in Growl since version 1.3, so you **must have an appropriate version of Growl installed** for Growly to work.
> 
> ## Example ##
> 
> Sending a minimal Growl notification:
> 
> ```javascript
> var growly = require('growly');
> 
> growly.notify('This is as easy as it gets', { title: 'Hello, World!' });
> ```
> 
> More examples can be found in the *example/* directory.
> 
> ## Usage ##
> 
> The growly module exposes only three methods: `Growly.register()`, `Growly.notify()`, and `Growly.setHost()`.
> 
> ### Growly.register(appname, [appicon], [notifications], [callback]) ###
> 
> Registers a new application with Growl. Registration is completely optional since it will be performed automatically for you with sensible defaults. Useful if you want your application, with its own icon and types of notifications, to show up in Growl's prefence panel.
> 
>   - `appname` the name of the application (required.)
>   - `appicon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for an application icon image.
>   - `notifications` a list of defined notification types with the following properties:
>     - `.label` name used to identify the type of notification being used (required.)
>     - `.dispname` name users will see in Growl's preference panel (defaults to `.label`.)
>     - `.enabled` whether or not notifications of this type are enabled (defaults to true.)
>   - `callback` called when the registration completes; if registration fails, the first argument will be an Error object.
> 
> An example:
> 
> ```javascript
> growly.register('My Application', 'path/to/icon.png', [
>     { label: 'success', dispname: 'Success' },
>     { label: 'warning', dispname: 'Warning', enabled: false }
> ], function(err) {
>     console.log(err || 'Registration successful!');
> });
> ```
> 
> ### Growly.notify(text, [opts], [callback]) ###
> 
> Sends a Growl notification. If an application wasn't registered beforehand with `growly.register()`, a default application will automatically be registered beforesending the notification.
> 
>   - `text` the body of the notification.
>   - `opts` an object with the following properties:
>     - `.title` title of the notification.
>     - `.icon` url, file path, or Buffer instance for the notification's icon.
>     - `.sticky` whether or not to sticky the notification (defaults to false.)
>     - `.label` type of notification to use (defaults to the first registered notification type.)
>     - `.priority` the priority of the notification from lowest (-2) to highest (2).
>     - `.coalescingId` replace/update the matching previous notification. May be ignored.
>   - `callback` called when the user has closed/clicked the notification. The callback is passed an Error object `err` as the first argument when the notification fails; otherwise, the second argument `action` is a string that'll describe which action has been taken by the user (either 'closed' or 'clicked'.)
> 
> An example:
> 
> ```javascript
> /* Assuming an application was registered with a notification type labeled 'warning'. */
> growly.notify('Stuffs broken!', { label: 'warning' }, function(err, action) {
>     console.log('Action:', action);
> });
> ```
> 
> ### Growly.setHost(host, port) ###
> 
> Set the host and port that Growl (GNTP) requests will be sent to. Using this method is optional since GNTP defaults to using host 'localhost' and port 23053.

## harmony-reflect@1.6.1

* **License(s):** (Apache-2.0 OR MPL-1.1)
* **Repository:** git+https://tvcutsem@github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect
* **Description:** ES5 shim for ES6 (ECMAScript 6) Reflect and Proxy objects
> [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/harmony-reflect) [![Dependencies](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect.png)](https://david-dm.org/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect)
> 
> This is a shim for the ECMAScript 6 [Reflect](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object) and [Proxy](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-proxy-objects) objects.
> 
> This library does two things:
> 
>   - It defines an ES6-compliant `Reflect` global object that exports the ECMAScript 6 reflection API.
>   - If harmony-era (pre-ES6) `Proxy` support is available, it patches `Proxy` to be up-to-date with the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/).
> 
> **July 2016 update**: the most recent version of all major browsers and node.js now [support fully
> ES6-compliant](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-Proxy) `Reflect` and `Proxy` objects. This shim is primarily useful if you want ES6 `Reflect`
> support on older browsers or versions of node.js < v6.0.0, or if you want
> ES6 `Proxy` support on versions of node.js < v6.0.0.
> 
> **May 2016 update**: the recently released [V8 v4.9](http://v8project.blogspot.com.au/2016/01/v8-release-49.html) includes native support for ES2015 Proxies and Reflect, making this library obsolete for environments that embed V8 4.9 or newer (like Chrome 49 and Node v6.0). Node v5.10.x or lower still requires this polyfill for proper ES6 Proxy support.
> 
> Read [Why should I use this library?](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/wiki)
> 
> Installation
> ============
> 
> For node.js, install via [npm](http://npmjs.org):
> 
>     npm install harmony-reflect
> 
> Then:
> 
>     node --harmony-proxies
>     > var Reflect = require('harmony-reflect');
> 
> See [release notes](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/blob/master/RELNOTES.md) for changes to the npm releases.
> 
> To use in a browser, just download the single reflect.js file. After loading
> 
>     <script src="reflect.js"></script>
> 
> a global object `Reflect` is defined that contains reflection methods as defined in the [ES6 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-reflect-object).
> 
> This library also updates the "harmony-era" `Proxy` object in the V8 engine
> (also used in node.js) to follow the latest [ECMAScript 2015](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) spec.
> To create such a proxy, call:
> 
>     var proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
> 
> See below for a list of spec incompatibilities and other gotcha's.
> 
> API Docs
> ========
> 
> This module exports an object named `Reflect` and updates the global `Proxy` object (if it exists) to be compatible with the latest ECMAScript 6 spec.
> 
> The ECMAScript 6 Proxy API allows one to intercept various operations on Javascript objects.
> 
>   * Overview of all [supported traps](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/traps.md) on proxies
>   * The [Reflect API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/api.md) 
>   * The Proxy [Handler API](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/doc/handler_api.md)
>   
> Compatibility
> =============
> 
> The `Reflect` API, with support for proxies, was tested on:
> 
>   * Firefox (>= v4.0)
>   * `node --harmony_proxies` (>= v0.7.8)
>   * `iojs --harmony_proxies` (>= 2.3.0)
>   * `v8 --harmony_proxies` (>= v3.6)
>   * Any recent `js` spidermonkey shell
> 
> If you need only `Reflect` and not an up-to-date `Proxy` object, this
> library should work on any modern ES5 engine (including all browsers).
> 
> Compatibility notes:
> 
>   * Chrome (>= v19 && <= v37) used to support proxies behind a flag
>     (`chrome://flags/#enable-javascript-harmony`) but Chrome v38  [removed](https://code.google.com/p/v8/issues/detail?id=1543#c44) the `Proxy` constructor. As a result, this library cannot patch the harmony-era `Proxy` object on Chrome v38 or above. If you're working with Chromium directly, it's still possible to enable proxies using `chromium-browser --js-flags="--harmony_proxies"`.
>   * In older versions of V8, the `Proxy` constructor was enabled by
>     default when starting V8 with `--harmony`. For recent versions of V8,
>     `Proxy` must be explicitly enabled with `--harmony_proxies`.
> 
> Dependencies
> ============
> 
>   *  ECMAScript 5/strict
>   *  To emulate direct proxies:
>     *  old Harmony [Proxies](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:proxies)
>     *  Harmony [WeakMaps](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:weak_maps)
> 
> After loading `reflect.js` into your page or other JS environment, be aware that the following globals are patched to be able to recognize emulated direct proxies:
> 
>     Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor
>     Object.defineProperty
>     Object.defineProperties
>     Object.getOwnPropertyNames
>     Object.getOwnPropertySymbols
>     Object.keys
>     Object.{get,set}PrototypeOf
>     Object.assign
>     Object.{freeze,seal,preventExtensions}
>     Object.{isFrozen,isSealed,isExtensible}
>     Object.prototype.valueOf
>     Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf
>     Object.prototype.toString
>     Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty
>     Function.prototype.toString
>     Date.prototype.toString
>     Array.isArray
>     Array.prototype.concat
>     Proxy
>     Reflect
> 
> :warning: In node.js, when you `require('harmony-reflect')`, only the current
> module's globals are patched. If you pass an emulated direct proxy to an external module, and that module uses the unpatched globals, the module may not interact with the proxy according to the latest ES6 Proxy API, instead falling
> back on the old pre-ES6 Proxy API. This can cause bugs, e.g. the built-in `Array.isArray` will return `false` when passed a proxy-for-array, while the
> patched `Array.isArray` will return true. I know of no good fix to reliably patch the globals for all node modules. If you do, let me know.
> 
> Examples
> ========
> 
> The [examples](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/tree/master/examples) directory contains a number of examples demonstrating the use of proxies:
> 
>   * membranes: wrappers that transitively isolate two object-graphs.
>   * observer: a self-hosted implementation of the ES7 `Object.observe` notification mechanism.
>   * profiler: a simple profiler to collect usage statistics of an object.

> Other example uses of proxies (not done by me, but using this library):
> 
>   * supporting [negative array indices](https://github.com/sindresorhus/negative-array) a la Python
>   * [tpyo](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/tpyo): using proxies to correct typo's in JS property names
>   * [persistent objects](http://tagtree.tv/es6-proxies): shows how one might go about using proxies to save updates to objects in a database incrementally

> Proxy Handler API
> =================
> 
> The sister project [proxy-handlers](https://github.com/tvcutsem/proxy-handlers)
> defines a number of predefined Proxy handlers as "abstract classes" that your 
> code can "subclass" The goal is to minimize the number of traps that your proxy
> handlers must implement.
> 
> Spec Incompatibilities and other gotcha's
> =========================================
> 
> This library differs from the [ECMAScript 2016 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html) as follows:
> 
>   * In ES7, the `enumerate()` trap, and the corresponding `Reflect.enumerate()` method, have been [removed](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/issues/161).
>     This shim still supports the trap.
>   * The ES7 (and ES6) spec contains a 
>     [bug](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666) that leads to missing
>     invariant checks in the getOwnPropertyDescriptor, defineProperty and deleteProperty traps. This library already contains the patch referred
>     to in [this issue](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/666).
> 
> This library differs from the [ECMAScript 2015 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/) as follows:
> 
>   * In ES6, `Proxy` is a constructor function that _requires_ the use
>     of `new`. That is, you must write `new Proxy(target, handler)`. This library
>     exports `Proxy` as an ordinary function which may be called with or without using the `new` operator.
>     
>   * In ES6, `Function.prototype.toString` and `Date.prototype.toString` do not
>     operate transparently on Proxies. This shim patches those functions so that
>     stringifying a Proxy-for-a-function or a Proxy-for-a-date "unwraps" the
>     proxy and instead stringifies the target of the Proxy. This behavior may
>     change in the future to be more spec-compatible.
>     
>   * This library does not shim [Symbol objects](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-symbol-objects).
>     On modern V8 or io.js which supports Symbol objects natively, due to a bug in V8, Symbols and Proxies
>     don't play well together. [Read more](https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/57).
>   
>   * Proxies-for-arrays are serialized as JSON objects rather than as JSON arrays. That is, `JSON.stringify(new Proxy([], {}))` returns "{}" rather than "[]". [Read more]( https://github.com/tvcutsem/harmony-reflect/issues/13#issuecomment-17249465).

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent

* **Description:** An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
* **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2013 Nathan Rajlich &lt;nathan@tootallnate.net&gt;

> https-proxy-agent
> ================
> ### An HTTP(s) proxy `http.Agent` implementation for HTTPS
> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/TooTallNate/node-https-proxy-agent)
> 
> This module provides an `http.Agent` implementation that connects to a specified
> HTTP or HTTPS proxy server, and can be used with the built-in `https` module.
> 
> Specifically, this `Agent` implementation connects to an intermediary "proxy"
> server and issues the [CONNECT HTTP method][CONNECT], which tells the proxy to
> open a direct TCP connection to the destination server.
> 
> Since this agent implements the CONNECT HTTP method, it also works with other
> protocols that use this method when connecting over proxies (i.e. WebSockets).
> See the "Examples" section below for more.
> 
> 
> Installation
> ------------
> 
> Install with `npm`:
> 
> ``` bash
> $ npm install https-proxy-agent
> ```
> 
> 
> Examples
> --------
> 
> #### `https` module example
> 
> ``` js
> var url = require('url');
> var https = require('https');
> var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');
> 
> // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
> var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
> console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);
> 
> // HTTPS endpoint for the proxy to connect to
> var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'https://graph.facebook.com/tootallnate';
> console.log('attempting to GET %j', endpoint);
> var options = url.parse(endpoint);
> 
> // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
> var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(proxy);
> options.agent = agent;
> 
> https.get(options, function (res) {
>   console.log('"response" event!', res.headers);
>   res.pipe(process.stdout);
> });
> ```
> 
> #### `ws` WebSocket connection example
> 
> ``` js
> var url = require('url');
> var WebSocket = require('ws');
> var HttpsProxyAgent = require('https-proxy-agent');
> 
> // HTTP/HTTPS proxy to connect to
> var proxy = process.env.http_proxy || 'http://168.63.76.32:3128';
> console.log('using proxy server %j', proxy);
> 
> // WebSocket endpoint for the proxy to connect to
> var endpoint = process.argv[2] || 'ws://echo.websocket.org';
> var parsed = url.parse(endpoint);
> console.log('attempting to connect to WebSocket %j', endpoint);
> 
> // create an instance of the `HttpsProxyAgent` class with the proxy server information
> var options = url.parse(proxy);
> 
> var agent = new HttpsProxyAgent(options);
> 
> // finally, initiate the WebSocket connection
> var socket = new WebSocket(endpoint, { agent: agent });
> 
> socket.on('open', function () {
>   console.log('"open" event!');
>   socket.send('hello world');
> });
> 
> socket.on('message', function (data, flags) {
>   console.log('"message" event! %j %j', data, flags);
>   socket.close();
> });
> ```
> 
> API
> ---
> 
> ### new HttpsProxyAgent(Object options)
> 
> The `HttpsProxyAgent` class implements an `http.Agent` subclass that connects
> to the specified "HTTP(s) proxy server" in order to proxy HTTPS and/or WebSocket
> requests. This is achieved by using the [HTTP `CONNECT` method][CONNECT].
> 
> The `options` argument may either be a string URI of the proxy server to use, or an
> "options" object with more specific properties:
> 
>   * `host` - String - Proxy host to connect to (may use `hostname` as well). Required.
>   * `port` - Number - Proxy port to connect to. Required.
>   * `secureProxy` - Boolean - If `true`, then use TLS to connect to the proxy. Defaults to `false`.
>   * `headers` - Object - Additional HTTP headers to be sent on the HTTP CONNECT method.
>   * Any other options given are passed to the `net.connect()`/`tls.connect()` functions.

> # ICSS — Replace Symbols
> 
> Governs the way tokens are searched & replaced during the linking stage of ICSS loading.
> 
> This is broken into its own module in case the behaviour needs to be replicated in other PostCSS plugins (i.e. [CSS Modules Constants](https://github.com/css-modules/postcss-modules-constants))

> 
> ```js
> import replaceSymbols from "icss-replace-symbols"
> replaceSymbols(css, translations)
> ```
> 
> Where:
> 
> - `css` is the PostCSS tree you're working with
> - `translations` is an JS object of `symbol: "replacement"` pairs, where all occurrences of `symbol` are replaced with `replacement`.
> 
> ## Behaviour
> 
> A symbol is a string of alphanumeric, `-` or `_` characters. A replacement can be any string. They are replaced in the following places:
> 
> - In the value of a declaration, i.e. `color: my_symbol;` or `box-shadow: 0 0 blur spread shadow-color`
> - In a media expression i.e. `@media small {}` or `@media screen and not-large {}`

> 
>      All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
>      Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
>      the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
>      Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
>      License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
>      attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
>      Form.
> 
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
> 
>      If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
> 
>      a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
>         as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the
>         Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by
>         reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost
>         of distribution to the recipient; and
> 
>      b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>         License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>         license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the
>         recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
> 
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
> 
>      You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
>      provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
>      the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
>      Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
>      Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
>      License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
>      under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
>      the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
>      Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
>      License(s).
> 
> 3.4. Notices
> 
>      You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
>      (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
>      limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the
>      Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the
>      extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
> 
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
> 
>      You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
>      indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
>      Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
>      behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
>      such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
>      You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
>      liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
>      indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
>      disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
>      jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
> 
>    If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License
>    with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute,
>    judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of
>    this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the
>    limitations and the code they affect. Such description must be placed in a
>    text file included with all distributions of the Covered Software under
>    this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or regulation,
>    such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary
>    skill to be able to understand it.
> 
> 5. Termination
> 
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
>      fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant,
>      then the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor
>      are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor
>      explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing
>      basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by
>      some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have come back into
>      compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor are
>      reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
>      non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have
>      received notice of non-compliance with this License from such
>      Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt
>      of the notice.
> 
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
>      infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
>      counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
>      directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
>      You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
>      2.1 of this License shall terminate.
> 
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
>      license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
>      validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
>      termination shall survive termination.
> 
> 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
> 
>    Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis,
>    without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory,
>    including, without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free
>    of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing.
>    The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Covered Software
>    is with You. Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect,
>    You (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
>    repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential
>    part of this License. No use of  any Covered Software is authorized under
>    this License except under this disclaimer.
> 
> 7. Limitation of Liability
> 
>    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
>    negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
>    distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any
>    direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
>    character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
>    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
>    other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been
>    informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability
>    shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from
>    such party's negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
>    limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
>    incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may
>    not apply to You.
> 
> 8. Litigation
> 
>    Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
>    of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of
>    business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
>    jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing
>    in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring cross-claims or
>    counter-claims.
> 
> 9. Miscellaneous
> 
>    This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
>    matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
>    unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
>    necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides that
>    the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not
>    be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
> 
> 
> 10. Versions of the License
> 
> 10.1. New Versions
> 
>       Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
>       10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or
>       publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a
>       distinguishing version number.
> 
> 10.2. Effect of New Versions
>

> # ignore
> 
> `ignore` is a manager, filter and parser which implemented in pure JavaScript according to the .gitignore [spec](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).
> 
> Pay attention that [`minimatch`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/minimatch) does not work in the gitignore way. To filter filenames according to .gitignore file, I recommend this module.
> 
> ##### Tested on
> 
> - Linux + Node: `0.8` - `7.x`
> - Windows + Node: `0.10` - `7.x`, node < `0.10` is not tested due to the lack of support of appveyor.
> 
> Actually, `ignore` does not rely on any versions of node specially.
> 
> ## Table Of Main Contents
> 
> - [Usage](#usage)
> - [Guide for 2.x -> 3.x](#upgrade-2x---3x)
> - [Contributing](#contributing)
> - Related Packages
>   - [`glob-gitignore`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob-gitignore) matches files using patterns and filters them according to gitignore rules.
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ```js
> const ignore = require('ignore')
> const ig = ignore().add(['.abc/*', '!.abc/d/'])
> ```
> 
> ### Filter the given paths
> 
> ```js
> const paths = [
>   '.abc/a.js',    // filtered out
>   '.abc/d/e.js'   // included
> ]
> 
> ig.filter(paths)        // ['.abc/d/e.js']
> ig.ignores('.abc/a.js') // true
> ```
> 
> ### As the filter function
> 
> ```js
> paths.filter(ig.createFilter()); // ['.abc/d/e.js']
> ```
> 
> ### Win32 paths will be handled
> 
> ```js
> ig.filter(['.abc\\a.js', '.abc\\d\\e.js'])
> // if the code above runs on windows, the result will be
> // ['.abc\\d\\e.js']
> ```
> 
> ## Why another ignore?
> 
> - `ignore` is a standalone module, and is much simpler so that it could easy work with other programs, unlike [isaacs](https://npmjs.org/~isaacs)'s [fstream-ignore](https://npmjs.org/package/fstream-ignore) which must work with the modules of the fstream family.
> 
> - `ignore` only contains utility methods to filter paths according to the specified ignore rules, so
>   - `ignore` never try to find out ignore rules by traversing directories or fetching from git configurations.
>   - `ignore` don't cares about sub-modules of git projects.
> 
> - Exactly according to [gitignore man page](http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), fixes some known matching issues of fstream-ignore, such as:
>   - '`/*.js`' should only match '`a.js`', but not '`abc/a.js`'.
>   - '`**/foo`' should match '`foo`' anywhere.
>   - Prevent re-including a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded.
>   - Handle trailing whitespaces:
>     - `'a '`(one space) should not match `'a  '`(two spaces).
>     - `'a \ '` matches `'a  '`
>   - All test cases are verified with the result of `git check-ignore`.
> 
> ## Methods
> 
> ### .add(pattern)
> ### .add(patterns)
> 
> - **pattern** `String|Ignore` An ignore pattern string, or the `Ignore` instance
> - **patterns** `Array.<pattern>` Array of ignore patterns.
> 
> Adds a rule or several rules to the current manager.
> 
> Returns `this`
> 
> Notice that a line starting with `'#'`(hash) is treated as a comment. Put a backslash (`'\'`) in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash, if you want to ignore a file with a hash at the beginning of the filename.
> 
> ```js
> ignore().add('#abc').ignores('#abc')    // false
> ignore().add('\#abc').ignores('#abc')   // true
> ```
> 
> `pattern` could either be a line of ignore pattern or a string of multiple ignore patterns, which means we could just `ignore().add()` the content of a ignore file:
> 
> ```js
> ignore()
> .add(fs.readFileSync(filenameOfGitignore).toString())
> .filter(filenames)
> ```
> 
> `pattern` could also be an `ignore` instance, so that we could easily inherit the rules of another `Ignore` instance.
> 
> ### <strike>.addIgnoreFile(path)</strike>
> 
> REMOVED in `3.x` for now.
> 
> To upgrade `ignore@2.x` up to `3.x`, use
> 
> ```js
> const fs = require('fs')
> 
> if (fs.existsSync(filename)) {
>   ignore().add(fs.readFileSync(filename).toString())
> }
> ```
> 
> instead.
> 
> 
> ### .ignores(pathname)
> 
> > new in 3.2.0
> 
> Returns `Boolean` whether `pathname` should be ignored.
> 
> ```js
> ig.ignores('.abc/a.js')    // true
> ```
> 
> ### .filter(paths)
> 
> Filters the given array of pathnames, and returns the filtered array.
> 
> - **paths** `Array.<path>` The array of `pathname`s to be filtered.
> 
> **NOTICE** that:
> 
> - `pathname` should be a string that have been `path.join()`ed, or the return value of `path.relative()` to the current directory.
> 
> ```js
> // WRONG
> ig.ignores('./abc')
> 
> // WRONG, for it will never happen.
> // If the gitignore rule locates at the root directory,
> // `'/abc'` should be changed to `'abc'`.
> // ```
> // path.relative('/', '/abc')  -> 'abc'
> // ```
> ig.ignores('/abc')
> 
> // Right
> ig.ignores('abc')
> 
> // Right
> ig.ignores(path.join('./abc'))  // path.join('./abc') -> 'abc'
> ```
> 
> - In other words, each `pathname` here should be a relative path to the directory of the git ignore rules.
> 
> Suppose the dir structure is:
> 
> ```
> /path/to/your/repo
>     |-- a
>     |   |-- a.js
>     |
>     |-- .b
>     |
>     |-- .c
>          |-- .DS_store
> ```
> 
> Then the `paths` might be like this:
> 
> ```js
> [
>   'a/a.js'
>   '.b',
>   '.c/.DS_store'
> ]
> ```
> 
> Usually, you could use [`glob`](http://npmjs.org/package/glob) with `option.mark = true` to fetch the structure of the current directory:
> 
> ```js
> const glob = require('glob')
> 
> glob('**', {
>   // Adds a / character to directory matches.
>   mark: true
> }, (err, files) => {
>   if (err) {
>     return console.error(err)
>   }
> 
>   let filtered = ignore().add(patterns).filter(files)
>   console.log(filtered)
> })
> ```
> 
> ### .createFilter()
> 
> Creates a filter function which could filter an array of paths with `Array.prototype.filter`.
> 
> Returns `function(path)` the filter function.
> 
> ****
> 
> ## Upgrade 2.x -> 3.x
> 
> - All `options` of 2.x are unnecessary and removed, so just remove them.
> - `ignore()` instance is no longer an [`EventEmitter`](nodejs.org/api/events.html), and all events are unnecessary and removed.
> - `.addIgnoreFile()` is removed, see the [.addIgnoreFile](#addignorefilepath) section for details.
> 
> ****
> 
> ## Contributing
> 
> The code of `node-ignore` is based on es6 and babel, but babel and its preset is not included in the `dependencies` field of package.json, so that the installation process of test cases will not fail in older versions of node.
> 
> So use `bash install.sh` to install dependencies and `bash test.sh` to run test cases in your local machine.

## imurmurhash@0.1.4

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js
* **Publisher:** Jens Taylor ( jensyt@gmail.com )
* **Description:** An incremental implementation of MurmurHash3
> iMurmurHash.js
> ==============
> 
> An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).
> 
> This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.
> 
> Installation
> ------------
> 
> To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.
> 
> ```html
> <script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
> <script>
> // Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
> </script>
> ```
> 
> ---
> 
> To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:
> 
> ```bash
> npm install imurmurhash
> ```
> 
> Then simply include it in your scripts:
> 
> ```javascript
> MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
> ```
> 
> Quick Example
> -------------
> 
> ```javascript
> // Create the initial hash
> var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');
> 
> // Incrementally add text
> hashState.hash('more strings');
> hashState.hash('even more strings');
> 
> // All calls can be chained if desired
> hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');
> 
> // Get a result
> hashState.result();
> // returns 0xe4ccfe6b
> ```
> 
> Functions
> ---------
> 
> ### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
> Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:
> 
> ```javascript
> // Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
> // object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
> hashState = MurmurHash3();
> ...
> 
> // Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
> // function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
> // will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
> hashState = new MurmurHash3();
> ```
> 
> Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
> Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.
> 
> ---
> 
> ### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
> Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.
> 
> ```javascript
> // Do the whole string at once
> MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
> // 0x70529328
> 
> // Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
> var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
> m.result();
> // 0xbfc4f834
> m.hash(' test string').result();
> // 0x70529328 (same as above)
> ```
> 
> ---
> 
> ### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
> Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/facebook/jest
* **Description:** `jest-docblock` is a package that can extract and parse a specially-formatted comment called a "docblock" at the top of a file.
> # jest-docblock
> 
> `jest-docblock` is a package that can extract and parse a specially-formatted comment called a "docblock" at the top of a file.
> 
> A docblock looks like this:
> 
> ```js
> /**
>  * Stuff goes here!
>  */
> ```
> 
> Docblocks can contain pragmas, which are words prefixed by `@`:
> 
> ```js
> /**
>  * Pragma incoming!
>  *
>  * @flow
>  */
> ```
> 
> Pragmas can also take arguments:
> 
> ```js
> /**
>  * Check this out:
>  *
>  * @myPragma it is so cool
>  */
> ```
> 
> `jest-docblock` can:
> 
> - extract the docblock from some code as a string
> - parse a docblock string's pragmas into an object
> - print an object and some comments back to a string
> 
> ## Installation
> 
> ```sh
> # with yarn
> $ yarn add jest-docblock
> # with npm
> $ npm install jest-docblock
> ```
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ```js
> const code = `
> /**
>  * Everything is awesome!
>  *
>  * @everything is:awesome
>  * @flow
>  */
> 
>  export const everything = Object.create(null);
>  export default function isAwesome(something) {
>    return something === everything;
>  }
> `;
> 
> const {
>   extract,
>   strip,
>   parse,
>   parseWithComments,
>   print,
> } = require('jest-docblock');
> 
> const docblock = extract(code);
> console.log(docblock); // "/**\n * Everything is awesome!\n * \n * @everything is:awesome\n * @flow\n */"
> 
> const stripped = strip(code);
> console.log(stripped); // "export const everything = Object.create(null);\n export default function isAwesome(something) {\n return something === everything;\n }"
> 
> const pragmas = parse(docblock);
> console.log(pragmas); // { everything: "is:awesome", flow: "" }
> 
> const parsed = parseWithComments(docblock);
> console.log(parsed); // { comments: "Everything is awesome!", pragmas: { everything: "is:awesome", flow: "" } }
> 
> console.log(print({pragmas, comments: 'hi!'})); // /**\n * hi!\n *\n * @everything is:awesome\n * @flow\n */;
> ```
> 
> ## API Documentation
> 
> ### `extract(contents: string): string`
> 
> Extracts a docblock from some file contents. Returns the docblock contained in `contents`. If `contents` did not contain a docblock, it will return the empty string (`""`).
> 
> ### `strip(contents: string): string`
> 
> Strips the top docblock from a file and return the result. If a file does not have a docblock at the top, then return the file unchanged.
> 
> ### `parse(docblock: string): {[key: string]: string | string[] }`
> 
> Parses the pragmas in a docblock string into an object whose keys are the pragma tags and whose values are the arguments to those pragmas.
> 
> ### `parseWithComments(docblock: string): { comments: string, pragmas: {[key: string]: string | string[]} }`
> 
> Similar to `parse` except this method also returns the comments from the docblock. Useful when used with `print()`.
> 
> ### `print({ comments?: string, pragmas?: {[key: string]: string | string[]} }): string`
> 
> Prints an object of key-value pairs back into a docblock. If `comments` are provided, they will be positioned on the top of the docblock.

> A parameterised testing library for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) inspired by [mocha-each](https://github.com/ryym/mocha-each).
> 
> jest-each allows you to provide multiple arguments to your `test`/`describe` which results in the test/suite being run once per row of parameters.
> 
> ## Features
> 
> - `.test` to runs multiple tests with parameterised data
>   - Also under the alias: `.it`
> - `.test.only` to only run the parameterised tests
>   - Also under the aliases: `.it.only` or `.fit`
> - `.test.skip` to skip the parameterised tests
>   - Also under the aliases: `.it.skip` or `.xit` or `.xtest`
> - `.describe` to runs test suites with parameterised data
> - `.describe.only` to only run the parameterised suite of tests
>   - Also under the aliases: `.fdescribe`
> - `.describe.skip` to skip the parameterised suite of tests
>   - Also under the aliases: `.xdescribe`
> - Asynchronous tests with `done`
> - Unique test titles with [`printf` formatting](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args):
>   - `%p` - [pretty-format](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-format).
>   - `%s`- String.
>   - `%d`- Number.
>   - `%i` - Integer.
>   - `%f` - Floating point value.
>   - `%j` - JSON.
>   - `%o` - Object.
>   - `%#` - Index of the test case.
>   - `%%` - single percent sign ('%'). This does not consume an argument.

> ## API
> 
> ### `constructor(global)`
> 
> Creates a new module mocker that generates mocks as if they were created in an environment with the given global object.
> 
> ### `generateFromMetadata(metadata)`
> 
> Generates a mock based on the given metadata (Metadata for the mock in the schema returned by the getMetadata method of this module). Mocks treat functions specially, and all mock functions have additional members, described in the documentation for `fn` in this module.
> 
> One important note: function prototypes are handled specially by this mocking framework. For functions with prototypes, when called as a constructor, the mock will install mocked function members on the instance. This allows different instances of the same constructor to have different values for its mocks member and its return values.
> 
> ### `getMetadata(component)`
> 
> Inspects the argument and returns its schema in the following recursive format:
> 
> ```
> {
>   type: ...
>   members: {}
> }
> ```
> 
> Where type is one of `array`, `object`, `function`, or `ref`, and members is an optional dictionary where the keys are member names and the values are metadata objects. Function prototypes are defined simply by defining metadata for the `member.prototype` of the function. The type of a function prototype should always be `object`. For instance, a simple class might be defined like this:
> 
> ```js
> const classDef = {
>   type: 'function',
>   members: {
>     staticMethod: {type: 'function'},
>     prototype: {
>       type: 'object',
>       members: {
>         instanceMethod: {type: 'function'},
>       },
>     },
>   },
> };

> Metadata may also contain references to other objects defined within the same metadata object. The metadata for the referent must be marked with `refID` key and an arbitrary value. The referrer must be marked with a `ref` key that has the same value as object with refID that it refers to. For instance, this metadata blob:
> 
> ```js
> const refID = {
>   type: 'object',
>   refID: 1,
>   members: {
>     self: {ref: 1},
>   },
> };
> ```
> 
> defines an object with a slot named `self` that refers back to the object.
> 
> ### `fn`
> 
> Generates a stand-alone function with members that help drive unit tests or confirm expectations. Specifically, functions returned by this method have the following members:
> 
> ##### `.mock`
> 
> An object with three members, `calls`, `instances` and `invocationCallOrder`, which are all lists. The items in the `calls` list are the arguments with which the function was called. The "instances" list stores the value of 'this' for each call to the function. This is useful for retrieving instances from a constructor. The `invocationCallOrder` lists the order in which the mock was called in relation to all mock calls, starting at 1.
> 
> ##### `.mockReturnValueOnce(value)`
> 
> Pushes the given value onto a FIFO queue of return values for the function.
> 
> ##### `.mockReturnValue(value)`
> 
> Sets the default return value for the function.
> 
> ##### `.mockImplementationOnce(function)`
> 
> Pushes the given mock implementation onto a FIFO queue of mock implementations for the function.
> 
> ##### `.mockImplementation(function)`
> 
> Sets the default mock implementation for the function.
> 
> ##### `.mockReturnThis()`
> 
> Syntactic sugar for .mockImplementation(function() {return this;})
> 
> In case both `mockImplementationOnce()/mockImplementation()` and `mockReturnValueOnce()/mockReturnValue()` are called. The priority of which to use is based on what is the last call:
> 
> - if the last call is mockReturnValueOnce() or mockReturnValue(), use the specific return value or default return value. If specific return values are used up or no default return value is set, fall back to try mockImplementation();
> - if the last call is mockImplementationOnce() or mockImplementation(), run the specific implementation and return the result or run default implementation and return the result.

* **Description:** Module for serializing and deserializing object into memory and disk. By default, the `v8` implementations are used, but if not present, it defaults to `JSON` implementation. Both serializers have the advantage of being able to serialize `Map`, `Set`, `undefined`, `NaN`, etc, although the JSON one does it through a replacer/reviver.

> ## Install
> 
> ```sh

> ```
> 
> ## API
> 
> Three kinds of API groups are exposed:
> 
> ### In-memory serialization: `serialize` and `deserialize`
> 
> This set of functions take or return a `Buffer`. All the process happens in memory. This is useful when willing to transfer over HTTP, TCP or via UNIX pipes.
> 
> ```javascript
> import {serialize, deserialize} from 'jest-serializer';
> 
> const myObject = {
>   foo: 'bar',
>   baz: [0, true, '2', [], {}],
> };
> 
> const buffer = serialize(myObject);
> const myCopyObject = deserialize(buffer);
> ```
> 
> ### Synchronous persistent filesystem: `readFileSync` and `writeFileSync`
> 
> This set of functions allow to send to disk a serialization result and retrieve it back, in a synchronous way. It mimics the `fs` API so it looks familiar.
> 
> ```javascript
> import {readFileSync, writeFileSync} from 'jest-serializer';
> 
> const myObject = {
>   foo: 'bar',
>   baz: [0, true, '2', [], {}],
> };
> 
> const myFile = '/tmp/obj';
> 
> writeFileSync(myFile, myObject);
> const myCopyObject = readFileSync(myFile);

> import {validate} from 'jest-validate';
> 
> validate((config: Object), (options: ValidationOptions)); // => {hasDeprecationWarnings: boolean, isValid: boolean}
> ```
> 
> Where `ValidationOptions` are:

> type ValidationOptions = {
>   blacklist?: Array<string>,
>   comment?: string,
>   condition?: (option: any, validOption: any) => boolean,

> 
> type Title = {|
>   deprecation?: string,
>   error?: string,
>   warning?: string,
> |};
> ```
> 
> `exampleConfig` is the only option required.
> 
> ## API
> 
> By default `jest-validate` will print generic warning and error messages. You can however customize this behavior by providing `options: ValidationOptions` object as a second argument:
> 
> Almost anything can be overwritten to suite your needs.
> 
> ### Options
> 
> - `recursiveBlacklist` – optional array of string keyPaths that should be excluded from deep (recursive) validation.
> - `comment` – optional string to be rendered below error/warning message.
> - `condition` – an optional function with validation condition.
> - `deprecate`, `error`, `unknown` – optional functions responsible for displaying warning and error messages.
> - `deprecatedConfig` – optional object with deprecated config keys.
> - `exampleConfig` – the only **required** option with configuration against which you'd like to test.
> - `recursive` - optional boolean determining whether recursively compare `exampleConfig` to `config` (default: `true`).
> - `title` – optional object of titles for errors and messages.
> 
> You will find examples of `condition`, `deprecate`, `error`, `unknown`, and `deprecatedConfig` inside source of this repository, named respectively.
> 
> ## Examples
> 
> Minimal example:
> 
> ```js
> validate(config, {exampleConfig});
> ```
> 
> Example with slight modifications:
> 
> ```js
> validate(config, {
>   comment: '  Documentation: http://custom-docs.com',
>   deprecatedConfig,
>   exampleConfig,
>   title: {
>     deprecation: 'Custom Deprecation',
>     // leaving 'error' and 'warning' as default
>   },
> });
> ```
> 
> This will output:
> 
> #### Warning:
> 
> ```bash
> ● Validation Warning:
> 
>   Unknown option transformx with value "<rootDir>/node_modules/babel-jest" was found.
>   This is either a typing error or a user mistake. Fixing it will remove this message.
> 
>   Documentation: http://custom-docs.com
> ```
> 
> #### Error:
> 
> ```bash
> ● Validation Error:
> 
>   Option transform must be of type:
>     object
>   but instead received:
>     string
> 
>   Example:
>   {
>     "transform": {
>       "^.+\\.js$": "<rootDir>/preprocessor.js"
>     }
>   }
> 
>   Documentation: http://custom-docs.com
> ```
> 
> #### Deprecation
> 
> Based on `deprecatedConfig` object with proper deprecation messages. Note custom title:
> 
> ```bash
> Custom Deprecation:
> 
>   Option scriptPreprocessor was replaced by transform, which support multiple preprocessors.
> 
>   Jest now treats your current configuration as:

## jest-worker@23.2.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/facebook/jest
* **Description:** Module for executing heavy tasks under forked processes in parallel, by providing a `Promise` based interface, minimum overhead, and bound workers.
> # jest-worker
> 
> Module for executing heavy tasks under forked processes in parallel, by providing a `Promise` based interface, minimum overhead, and bound workers.
> 
> The module works by providing an absolute path of the module to be loaded in all forked processes. Files relative to a node module are also accepted. All methods are exposed on the parent process as promises, so they can be `await`'ed. Child (worker) methods can either be synchronous or asynchronous.
> 
> The module also implements support for bound workers. Binding a worker means that, based on certain parameters, the same task will always be executed by the same worker. The way bound workers work is by using the returned string of the `computeWorkerKey` method. If the string was used before for a task, the call will be queued to the related worker that processed the task earlier; if not, it will be executed by the first available worker, then sticked to the worker that executed it; so the next time it will be processed by the same worker. If you have no preference on the worker executing the task, but you have defined a `computeWorkerKey` method because you want _some_ of the tasks to be sticked, you can return `null` from it.
> 
> The list of exposed methods can be explicitly provided via the `exposedMethods` option. If it is not provided, it will be obtained by requiring the child module into the main process, and analyzed via reflection. Check the "minimal example" section for a valid one.
> 
> ## Install
> 
> ```sh
> $ yarn add jest-worker
> ```
> 
> ## Example
> 
> This example covers the minimal usage:
> 
> ### File `parent.js`
> 
> ```javascript
> import Worker from 'jest-worker';
> 
> async function main() {
>   const worker = new Worker(require.resolve('./worker'));
>   const result = await worker.hello('Alice'); // "Hello, Alice"
> }
> 
> main();
> ```
> 
> ### File `worker.js`
> 
> ```javascript
> export function hello(param) {
>   return 'Hello, ' + param;
> }
> ```
> 
> ## API
> 
> The only exposed method is a constructor (`Worker`) that is initialized by passing the worker path, plus an options object.
> 
> ### `workerPath: string` (required)
> 
> Node module name or absolute path of the file to be loaded in the child processes. Use `require.resolve` to transform a relative path into an absolute one.
> 
> ### `options: Object` (optional)
> 
> #### `exposedMethods: $ReadOnlyArray<string>` (optional)
> 
> List of method names that can be called on the child processes from the parent process. You cannot expose any method named like a public `Worker` method, or starting with `_`. If you use method auto-discovery, then these methods will not be exposed, even if they exist.
> 
> #### `numWorkers: number` (optional)
> 
> Amount of workers to spawn. Defaults to the number of CPUs minus 1.
> 
> #### `maxRetries: number` (optional)
> 
> Maximum amount of times that a dead child can be re-spawned, per call. Defaults to `3`, pass `Infinity` to allow endless retries.
> 
> #### `forkOptions: Object` (optional)
> 
> Allow customizing all options passed to `childProcess.fork`. By default, some values are set (`cwd`, `env` and `execArgv`), but you can override them and customize the rest. For a list of valid values, check [the Node documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_fork_modulepath_args_options).
> 
> #### `computeWorkerKey: (method: string, ...args: Array<any>) => ?string` (optional)
> 
> Every time a method exposed via the API is called, `computeWorkerKey` is also called in order to bound the call to a worker. This is useful for workers that are able to cache the result or part of it. You bound calls to a worker by making `computeWorkerKey` return the same identifier for all different calls. If you do not want to bind the call to any worker, return `null`.
> 
> The callback you provide is called with the method name, plus all the rest of the arguments of the call. Thus, you have full control to decide what to return. Check a practical example on bound workers under the "bound worker usage" section.
> 
> By default, no process is bound to any worker.
> 
> ## Worker
> 
> The returned `Worker` instance has all the exposed methods, plus some additional ones to interact with the workers itself:
> 
> ### `getStdout(): Readable`
> 
> Returns a `ReadableStream` where the standard output of all workers is piped. Note that the `silent` option of the child workers must be set to `true` to make it work. This is the default set by `jest-worker`, but keep it in mind when overriding options through `forkOptions`.
> 
> ### `getStderr(): Readable`
> 
> Returns a `ReadableStream` where the standard error of all workers is piped. Note that the `silent` option of the child workers must be set to `true` to make it work. This is the default set by `jest-worker`, but keep it in mind when overriding options through `forkOptions`.
> 
> ### `end()`
> 
> Finishes the workers by killing all workers. No further calls can be done to the `Worker` instance.
> 
> **Note:** Each worker has a unique id (index that starts with `1`) which is available on `process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID`
> 
> # More examples
> 
> ## Standard usage
> 
> This example covers the standard usage:
> 
> ### File `parent.js`
> 
> ```javascript
> import Worker from 'jest-worker';
> 
> async function main() {
>   const myWorker = new Worker(require.resolve('./worker'), {
>     exposedMethods: ['foo', 'bar', 'getWorkerId'],
>     numWorkers: 4,
>   });
> 
>   console.log(await myWorker.foo('Alice')); // "Hello from foo: Alice"
>   console.log(await myWorker.bar('Bob')); // "Hello from bar: Bob"
>   console.log(await myWorker.getWorkerId()); // "3" -> this message has sent from the 3rd worker
> 
>   myWorker.end();
> }
> 
> main();
> ```
> 
> ### File `worker.js`
> 
> ```javascript
> export function foo(param) {
>   return 'Hello from foo: ' + param;
> }
> 
> export function bar(param) {
>   return 'Hello from bar: ' + param;
> }
> 
> export function getWorkerId() {
>   return process.env.JEST_WORKER_ID;
> }
> ```
> 
> ## Bound worker usage:
> 
> This example covers the usage with a `computeWorkerKey` method:
> 
> ### File `parent.js`
> 
> ```javascript
> import Worker from 'jest-worker';
> 
> async function main() {
>   const myWorker = new Worker(require.resolve('./worker'), {
>     computeWorkerKey: (method, filename) => filename,
>   });
> 
>   // Transform the given file, within the first available worker.
>   console.log(await myWorker.transform('/tmp/foo.js'));
> 
>   // Wait a bit.
>   await sleep(10000);
> 
>   // Transform the same file again. Will immediately return because the
>   // transformed file is cached in the worker, and `computeWorkerKey` ensures
>   // the same worker that processed the file the first time will process it now.
>   console.log(await myWorker.transform('/tmp/foo.js'));
> 
>   myWorker.end();
> }
> 
> main();
> ```
> 
> ### File `worker.js`
> 
> ```javascript
> import babel from 'babel-core';
> 
> const cache = Object.create(null);
> 
> export function transform(filename) {
>   if (cache[filename]) {
>     return cache[filename];
>   }
> 
>   // jest-worker can handle both immediate results and thenables. If a
>   // thenable is returned, it will be await'ed until it resolves.
>   return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
>     babel.transformFile(filename, (err, result) => {
>       if (err) {
>         reject(err);
>       } else {
>         resolve((cache[filename] = result));
>       }

> 
>   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
> software and other kinds of works.
> 
>   The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
> to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
> the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
> share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
> software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
> GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
> any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
> your programs, too.
> 
>   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
> price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
> have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
> them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
> want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
> free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
> 
>   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
> these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
> certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
> you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
> 
>   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
> gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
> freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
> or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
> know their rights.
> 
>   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
> (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
> giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
> 
>   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
> that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
> authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
> changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
> authors of previous versions.
> 
>   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
> modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
> can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
> protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
> pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
> use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
> have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
> products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
> stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
> of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
> 
>   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
> States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
> software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
> avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
> make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
> patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
> 
>   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
> modification follow.

>   "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
> 
>   "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
> works, such as semiconductor masks.
> 
>   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this

> 
>   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
> in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
> exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
> earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.
> 
>   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based

> 
>   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
> permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
> infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
> computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
> distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
> public, and in some countries other activities as well.
> 
>   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
> parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
> a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
> 
>   An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
> to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible

> tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the

>   1. Source Code.
> 
>   The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
> for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source

> 
>   A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
> standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of

> 
>   The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other

> packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
> Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
> Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
> implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
> "Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
> (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
> (if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
> produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
> 
>   The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
> the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
> work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to

> System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free

> the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically

>   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users

> Source.
> 
>   The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
> same work.
> 
>   2. Basic Permissions.
> 
>   All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
> copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
> conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
> permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
> covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
> content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
> rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
> 
>   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
> convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
> in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
> of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
> with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
> the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
> not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
> for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
> and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
> your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
> 
>   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
> the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
> makes it unnecessary.
> 
>   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
> 
>   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
> measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
> 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
> similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
> measures.
> 
>   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
> circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
> is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
> the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
> modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
> users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
> technological measures.
> 
>   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
> 
>   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
> receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
> appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
> keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
> non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
> keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
> recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
> 
>   You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
> and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
> 
>   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
> 
>   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
> produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
> terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
> 
>     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
>     it, and giving a relevant date.
> 
>     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
>     released under this License and any conditions added under section
>     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
>     "keep intact all notices".
> 
>     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
>     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
>     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
>     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
>     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
>     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
>     invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
> 
>     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
>     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
>     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
>     work need not make them do so.
> 
>   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
> works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
> and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
> in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
> "aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
> used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
> beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
> in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
> parts of the aggregate.
> 
>   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
> 
>   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
> of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
> machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
> in one of these ways:
> 
>     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
>     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
>     customarily used for software interchange.
> 
>     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
>     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
>     written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
>     long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
>     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
>     copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
>     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
>     medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
>     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
>     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
>     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
> 
>     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
>     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
>     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
>     only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
>     with subsection 6b.
> 
>     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
>     place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
>     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
>     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
>     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
>     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
>     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
>     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
>     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
>     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
>     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
>     available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
> 
>     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
>     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
>     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
>     charge under subsection 6d.
> 
>   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
> from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
> included in conveying the object code work.
> 
>   A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
> tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
> or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
> into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
> doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
> product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
> typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
> of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
> actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
> is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
> commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
> the only significant mode of use of the product.
> 
>   "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
> procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
> and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
> a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
> suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
> code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
> modification has been made.
> 
>   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
> specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
> part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
> User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
> fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
> Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
> by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
> if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
> modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
> been installed in ROM).
> 
>   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
> requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
> for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
> the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
> network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
> adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
> protocols for communication across the network.
> 
>   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
> in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
> documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
> source code form), and must require no special password or key for
> unpacking, reading or copying.
> 
>   7. Additional Terms.
> 
>   "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
> License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
> Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
> be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
> that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
> apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
> under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
> this License without regard to the additional permissions.
> 
>   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
> remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
> it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
> removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
> additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
> for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
> add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
> that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
> 
>     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
>     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
> 
>     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
>     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
>     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
> 
>     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
>     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
>     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
> 
>     d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
>     authors of the material; or
> 
>     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
>     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
> 
>     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
>     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
>     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
>     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
>     those licensors and authors.
> 
>   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
> restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
> received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
> governed by this License along with a term that is a further
> restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
> a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
> License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
> of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
> not survive such relicensing or conveying.
> 
>   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
> must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
> additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
> where to find the applicable terms.
> 
>   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
> form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
> the above requirements apply either way.
> 
>   8. Termination.
> 
>   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
> provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
> modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
> this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
> paragraph of section 11).
> 
>   However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
> license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
> provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
> finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
> holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
> prior to 60 days after the cessation.
> 
>   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
> reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
> violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
> received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
> copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
> your receipt of the notice.
> 
>   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
> licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
> this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
> reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
> material under section 10.
> 
>   9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
> 
>   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
> run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
> occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
> to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
> nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
> modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
> not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
> covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
> 
>   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
> 
>   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
> receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
> propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
> for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
> 
>   An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
> organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
> organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
> work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
> transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
> licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
> give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
> Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
> the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
> 
>   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
> rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
> not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
> rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
> (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
> any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
> sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
> 
>   11. Patents.
> 
>   A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
> License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
> work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".
> 
>   A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
> owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
> hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
> by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
> but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
> consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
> purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
> patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
> this License.
> 
>   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
> patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
> make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
> propagate the contents of its contributor version.
> 
>   In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
> agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
> (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
> sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
> party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
> patent against the party.
> 
>   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
> and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
> to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
> publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
> then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
> available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
> patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
> consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
> license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
> actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
> covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
> in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
> country that you have reason to believe are valid.
> 
>   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
> arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
> covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
> receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
> or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
> you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
> work and works based on it.
> 
>   A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
> the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
> conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
> specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
> work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
> in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
> to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
> the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
> parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
> patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
> conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
> for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
> contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
> or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
> 
>   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
> any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
> otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
> 
>   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
> 
>   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
> otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
> excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
> covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
> License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
> not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
> to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
> the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
> License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
> 
>   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
> 
>   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
> permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
> under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
> combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
> License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
> but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
> section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
> combination as such.
> 
>   14. Revised Versions of this License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
> the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
> be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
> address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
> Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
> Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
> option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
> version or of any later version published by the Free Software
> Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
> GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
> by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
>   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
> versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
> public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
> to choose that version for the Program.
> 
>   Later license versions may give you additional or different
> permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
> author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
> later version.
> 
>   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
> 
>   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
> APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
> HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
> OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
> THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
> PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
> IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
> ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
> 
>   16. Limitation of Liability.
> 
>   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
> WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
> THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
> GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
> USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
> DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
> PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
> EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
> SUCH DAMAGES.
> 
>   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
> 
>   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
> above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
> reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
> an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
> Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
> copy of the Program in return for a fee.
> 
>                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

> -------------------
> 
> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
> 
> All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
> Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
> the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
> Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
> License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
> attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
> Form.
> 
> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
> 
> If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
> 
> (a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
>     Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
>     the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
>     Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
>     than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
> 
> (b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
>     License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
>     license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
>     the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
> 
> 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
> 
> You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
> provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
> the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
> Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
> Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
> License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
> under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
> the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
> Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
> License(s).
> 
> 3.4. Notices
> 
> You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
> (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
> or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
> the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
> the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
> 
> 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
> 
> You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
> Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
> behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
> such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
> You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
> liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
> indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
> disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
> jurisdiction.
> 
> 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
> ---------------------------------------------------
> 
> If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
> License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
> statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
> the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
> describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
> be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
> Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
> or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
> recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
> 
> 5. Termination
> --------------
> 
> 5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
> if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
> compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
> Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
> ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
> non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
> come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
> Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
> notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
> first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
> from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
> Your receipt of the notice.
> 
> 5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
> infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
> counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
> directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
> You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
> 2.1 of this License shall terminate.
> 
> 5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
> end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
> have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
> prior to termination shall survive termination.

* **Publisher:** Ivan Akulov ( mail@iamakulov.com )
* **Description:** Strip unused locales from Moment.js

> [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/moment-locales-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment-locales-webpack-plugin) [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/iamakulov/moment-locales-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/iamakulov/moment-locales-webpack-plugin) [![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/iamakulov/moment-locales-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)
> 
> 
> 
> > Easily remove unused Moment.js locales when building with webpack
> 
> 
> 
> ## Why
> 
> 
> 
> 75% (160 minified KBs)¹ of [Moment.js’](https://github.com/moment/moment) size are files used for localization. [They are always included](https://iamakulov.com/notes/webpack-front-end-size-caching/#moment-js) when you build your app with webpack.
> 
> 
> 
> You don’t need most of these files if your app is only available in a few languages. Use this plugin to strip these KBs and optimize the app!
> 
> 
> 
> <small>¹ – tested with Moment.js 2.18.1</small>
> 
> 
> 
> ## Install
> 
> 
> 
> ```sh
> 
> npm install --save-dev moment-locales-webpack-plugin
> 
> ```
> 
> 
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> 
> 
> ```js
> 
> // webpack.config.js
> 
> const MomentLocalesPlugin = require('moment-locales-webpack-plugin');
> 
> 
> 
> module.exports = {
> 
>     plugins: [
> 
>         // To strip all locales except “en”
> 
>         new MomentLocalesPlugin(),
> 
> 
> 
>         // Or: To strip all locales except “en”, “es-us” and “ru”
> 
>         // (“en” is built into Moment and can’t be removed)
> 
>         new MomentLocalesPlugin({
> 
>             localesToKeep: ['es-us', 'ru'],
> 
>         }),
> 
>     ],
> 
> };
> 
> ```
> 
> 
> 
> ## Plugin Options
> 
> 
> 
> ### **`localesToKeep: String[]`**
> 
> 
> 
> An array of locales to keep bundled (other locales would be removed).
> 
> 
> 
> Locale names follow Moment.js behavior – if a specific locale name (e.g. `ru-ru`) is absent, but a more generic locale (`ru`) is available, the generic one will be kept bundled.

> ===============
> 
> Compare strings containing a mix of letters and numbers

> This is described as a "natural ordering".
> 
> ```text
> Standard sorting:   Natural order sorting:
>     img1.png            img1.png
>     img10.png           img2.png
>     img12.png           img10.png
>     img2.png            img12.png

> 
> String.naturalCompare returns a number indicating
> whether a reference string comes before or after or is the same
> as the given string in sort order.
> Use it with builtin sort() function.
> 
> 
> 
> ### Installation
> 
> - In browser
> 
> ```html
> <script src=min.natural-compare.js></script>
> ```
> 
> - In node.js: `npm install natural-compare-lite`
> 
> ```javascript
> require("natural-compare-lite")
> ```
> 
> ### Usage
> 
> ```javascript
> // Simple case sensitive example
> var a = ["z1.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z2.doc", "z23.doc", "z3.doc"];
> a.sort(String.naturalCompare);
> // ["z1.doc", "z2.doc", "z3.doc", "z10.doc", "z17.doc", "z23.doc"]
> 
> // Use wrapper function for case insensitivity
> a.sort(function(a, b){
>   return String.naturalCompare(a.toLowerCase(), b.toLowerCase());
> })
> 
> // In most cases we want to sort an array of objects
> var a = [ {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-1021"}
>         , {"street":"350 5th Ave", "room":"A-21046-b"} ];
> 
> // sort by street, then by room
> a.sort(function(a, b){
>   return String.naturalCompare(a.street, b.street) || String.naturalCompare(a.room, b.room);
> })
> 
> // When text transformation is needed (eg toLowerCase()),
> // it is best for performance to keep
> // transformed key in that object.
> // There are no need to do text transformation
> // on each comparision when sorting.
> var a = [ {"make":"Audi", "model":"A6"}
>         , {"make":"Kia",  "model":"Rio"} ];
> 
> // sort by make, then by model
> a.map(function(car){
>   car.sort_key = (car.make + " " + car.model).toLowerCase();
> })
> a.sort(function(a, b){
>   return String.naturalCompare(a.sort_key, b.sort_key);
> })
> ```
> 
> - Works well with dates in ISO format eg "Rev 2012-07-26.doc".
> 
> 
> ### Custom alphabet
> 
> It is possible to configure a custom alphabet
> to achieve a desired order.
> 
> ```javascript
> // Estonian alphabet
> String.alphabet = "ABDEFGHIJKLMNOPRSŠZŽTUVÕÄÖÜXYabdefghijklmnoprsšzžtuvõäöüxy"
> ["t", "z", "x", "õ"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
> // ["z", "t", "õ", "x"]
> 
> // Russian alphabet
> String.alphabet = "АБВГДЕЁЖЗИЙКЛМНОПРСТУФХЦЧШЩЪЫЬЭЮЯабвгдеёжзийклмнопрстуфхцчшщъыьэюя"
> ["Ё", "А", "Б"].sort(String.naturalCompare)
> // ["А", "Б", "Ё"]

## pn@1.1.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/cscott/node-pn
* **Publisher:** C. Scott Ananian
* **Description:** Promisify the node standard library.
* **Copyright:** Copyright (c) 2014-2018 C. Scott Ananian

> # pn
> [![NPM][NPM1]][NPM2]
> 
> [![Build Status][1]][2]
> 
> The `pn` library gives you the Promise-using node standard library
> you've always dreamed of.  Think "Promised Node" when saying it.
> 
> Just about every node standard library method that takes a callback will now
> return a `Promise` iff no callback is supplied.  But existing code
> that passes callbacks will still work fine --- and fast:  No unnecessary
> `Promise`s are created if you supply a callback.
> 
> The wrappers are generated automatically by a script, with a table to
> handle exceptions and odd cases.  See below for more details.
> 
> ## Installation
> ```
> npm install pn
> ```
> ## Usage
> ```
> var fs = require('pn/fs');
> fs.writeFile('foo', 'bar', 'utf-8').then(function() { console.log('done'); });
> // But you can use callbacks, too -- existing code won't break.
> fs.writeFile('foo', 'bat', 'utf-8', function(err) { console.log('yay'); });
> ```
> 
> This library uses node native promises (ie `global.Promise`) by
> default, and thus works with node >= 0.11.
> 
> You can use [`core-js`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/core-js) or
> [`es6-shim`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/es6-shim)
> to add ES6 Promises to earlier versions of node, for example:
> ```
> require('es6-shim');
> var fs = require('pn/fs');
> ```
> Just be sure that `es6-shim` is loaded before the `pn` package in that
> case.
> 
> You might also want to look into packages like
> [`prfun`](https://www.npmjs.org/package/prfun)
> which add some helpers to make working with native promises much more
> fun.
> 
> In particular, the `Promise#done` method is very useful when
> debugging, at least until v8's native Promise debugging
> capabilities are completed.
> 
> ## Custom Promise types
> 
> You can also specify a custom `Promise` type to use, as follows:
> ```
> var MyPromise = require('prfun');  // Use prfun's Promises, for example.
> require('pn/_promise')(MyPromise); // This only needs to be done once.
> ```
> 
> ## Exceptions and odd cases
> 
> The wrappers are automatically generated by `scripts/generate.js`;
> there is a table in that file which specifies all the odd cases.
> 
> In general: if the node API has a callback which takes multiple
> value arguments, the `Promise` returned will be an object with
> named fields corresponding to the different values. If the node
> API takes a callback *and* returns a value, `pn` will return
> the original value with a nonenumerable field named `promise`
> corresponding to the callback.  Combining these two cases:
> ```
> var child_process = require('pn/child_process');
> var cp = child_process.execFile('true');
> console.log('pid', cp.pid);
> cp.promise.then(function(result) {
>   console.log('stdout: ', result.stdout);
>   console.log('stderr: ', result.stderr);
> });
> ```
> 
> * `child_process`: The `exec` and `execFile` methods promise a object
>   with fields named `stdout` and `stderr`.  They return a `ChildProcess`
>   object with a nonenumerable field named `promise` corresponding to the
>   callback.
> * `crypto`: The `randomBytes` and `pseudoRandomBytes` methods are
>   now always asynchronous, returning a `Promise` if no callback
>   is supplied.  Use the new `randomBytesSync` and `pseudoRandomBytesSync`
>   methods if you want synchronous computation.  *This is backwards
>   incompatible with existing node code.*
> * `dns`: The `lookupService` method promises an object with
>   fields named `hostname` and `service`.
> * `fs`: The `exists` method doesn't pass an error to its callback.
>   The promisied version will never reject.  The `write` method promises
>   an object with fields named `written` and `data`.  The `read` method
>   promises an object with fields named `read` and `data`.
> * `http`, `https`: The `request` and `get` methods return a `ClientRequest`
>   object with a nonenumerable field named `promise`, which will
>   resolve to an `IncomingMessage` object.
> * `process`: You can defer computation to the next tick with
>   `require('pn/process').nextTick().then(function(){...})`
> * `tls`: The `connect` and `createServer` return objects with a
>   nonenumerable field named `promise`.
> 
> There are a few object methods which are not promisified by this
> package:
> * `domain`: `Domain#bind`, `Domain#intercept`
> * `http`,`https`: `ClientRequest#setTimeout`, `IncomingMessage#setTimeout`,
>   `Server#setTimeout`, `ServerResponse#setTimeout`, `Server#listen`,
>   `Server#close`
> * `net`: `Server#listen`, `Server#close`, `Server#getConnections`,
>   `Socket#write`, `Socket#setTimeout`
> * `readline`: `Interface#question`
> * `stream`: `Writable#write`, `Writable#end`
> * `dgram`: `Socket#send`, `Socket#bind`.
>

> 
> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/css-modules/postcss-modules-scope)

> 
> Since we're exporting class names, there's no reason to export only one. This can give us some really useful reuse of styles:

> }
> :local(.continueButton) {
>   compose-with: globalButtonStyle;
>   color: green;
> }
> ```
> 
> becomes:
> 
> ```
> .globalButtonStyle {
>   background: white;
>   border: 1px solid;
>   border-radius: 0.25rem;
> }
> .globalButtonStyle:hover {
>   box-shadow: 0 0 4px -2px;
> }
> :local(.continueButton) {
>   compose-with: globalButtonStyle;
>   color: green;
> }
> ```
> 
> **Note:** you can also use `composes` as a shorthand for `compose-with`
> 
> ## Local-by-default & reuse across files
> 
> You're looking for [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules). It uses this plugin as well as a few others, and it's amazing.

> 
> ```css
> /* colors.css */
> @value primary: #BF4040;
> @value secondary: #1F4F7F;
> 
> .text-primary {
>   color: primary;
> }
> 
> .text-secondary {
>   color: secondary;
> }
> ```
> 
> ```css
> /* breakpoints.css */
> @value small: (max-width: 599px);
> @value medium: (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 959px);
> @value large: (min-width: 960px);
> ```
> 
> ```css
> /* my-component.css */
> /* alias paths for other values or composition */
> @value colors: "./colors.css"; 
> /* import multiple from a single file */
> @value primary, secondary from colors;
> /* make local aliases to imported values */
> @value small as bp-small, large as bp-large from "./breakpoints.css";
> 
> .header {
>   composes: text-primary from colors;
>   box-shadow: 0 0 10px secondary;
> }
> 
> @media bp-small {
>   .header {
>     box-shadow: 0 0 4px secondary;
>   }
> }
> @media bp-large {
>   .header {
>     box-shadow: 0 0 20px secondary;
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> **If you are using Sass** along with this PostCSS plugin, do not use the colon `:` in your `@value` definitions. It will cause Sass to crash.
> 
> Note also you can _import_ multiple values at once but can only _define_ one value per line.

> ```css
> @value a: b, c: d; /* defines a as "b, c: d" */

>   prop: 'yellow',
>   tag: 'cyan',
>   value: 'green',
> };
> ```
> 
> ## Usage with plugins
> 
> The `pretty-format` package provides some built-in plugins, including:
> 
> - `ReactElement` for elements from `react`
> - `ReactTestComponent` for test objects from `react-test-renderer`
> 
> ```js
> // CommonJS
> const prettyFormat = require('pretty-format');
> const ReactElement = prettyFormat.plugins.ReactElement;
> const ReactTestComponent = prettyFormat.plugins.ReactTestComponent;
> 
> const React = require('react');
> const renderer = require('react-test-renderer');
> ```
> 
> ```js
> // ES2015 modules and destructuring assignment
> import prettyFormat from 'pretty-format';
> const {ReactElement, ReactTestComponent} = prettyFormat.plugins;
> 
> import React from 'react';
> import renderer from 'react-test-renderer';
> ```
> 
> ```js
> const onClick = () => {};
> const element = React.createElement('button', {onClick}, 'Hello World');
> 
> const formatted1 = prettyFormat(element, {
>   plugins: [ReactElement],
>   printFunctionName: false,
> });
> const formatted2 = prettyFormat(renderer.create(element).toJSON(), {
>   plugins: [ReactTestComponent],
>   printFunctionName: false,
> });
> /*
> <button
>   onClick=[Function]
> >
>   Hello World
> </button>
> */
> ```
> 
> ## Usage in Jest
> 
> For snapshot tests, Jest uses `pretty-format` with options that include some of its built-in plugins. For this purpose, plugins are also known as **snapshot serializers**.
> 
> To serialize application-specific data types, you can add modules to `devDependencies` of a project, and then:
> 
> In an **individual** test file, you can add a module as follows. It precedes any modules from Jest configuration.
> 
> ```js
> import serializer from 'my-serializer-module';
> expect.addSnapshotSerializer(serializer);
> 
> // tests which have `expect(value).toMatchSnapshot()` assertions
> ```
> 
> For **all** test files, you can specify modules in Jest configuration. They precede built-in plugins for React, HTML, and Immutable.js data types. For example, in a `package.json` file:
> 
> ```json
> {
>   "jest": {
>     "snapshotSerializers": ["my-serializer-module"]
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> ## Writing plugins
> 
> A plugin is a JavaScript object.
> 
> If `options` has a `plugins` array: for the first plugin whose `test(val)` method returns a truthy value, then `prettyFormat(val, options)` returns the result from either:
> 
> - `serialize(val, …)` method of the **improved** interface (available in **version 21** or later)
> - `print(val, …)` method of the **original** interface (if plugin does not have `serialize` method)
> 
> ### test
> 
> Write `test` so it can receive `val` argument of any type. To serialize **objects** which have certain properties, then a guarded expression like `val != null && …` or more concise `val && …` prevents the following errors:
> 
> - `TypeError: Cannot read property 'whatever' of null`
> - `TypeError: Cannot read property 'whatever' of undefined`
> 
> For example, `test` method of built-in `ReactElement` plugin:
> 
> ```js
> const elementSymbol = Symbol.for('react.element');
> const test = val => val && val.$$typeof === elementSymbol;
> ```
> 
> Pay attention to efficiency in `test` because `pretty-format` calls it often.
> 
> ### serialize
> 
> The **improved** interface is available in **version 21** or later.
> 
> Write `serialize` to return a string, given the arguments:
> 
> - `val` which “passed the test”
> - unchanging `config` object: derived from `options`
> - current `indentation` string: concatenate to `indent` from `config`
> - current `depth` number: compare to `maxDepth` from `config`
> - current `refs` array: find circular references in objects
> - `printer` callback function: serialize children
> 
> ### config

> | :------------------ | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
> | `callToJSON`        | `boolean` | call `toJSON` method (if it exists) on objects          |
> | `colors`            | `Object`  | escape codes for colors to highlight syntax             |
> | `escapeRegex`       | `boolean` | escape special characters in regular expressions        |
> | `indent`            | `string`  | spaces in each level of indentation                     |
> | `maxDepth`          | `number`  | levels to print in arrays, objects, elements, and so on |
> | `min`               | `boolean` | minimize added space: no indentation nor line breaks    |

> | `printFunctionName` | `boolean` | include or omit the name of a function                  |
> | `spacingInner`      | `strong`  | spacing to separate items in a list                     |
> | `spacingOuter`      | `strong`  | spacing to enclose a list of items                      |
> 
> Each property of `colors` in `config` corresponds to a property of `theme` in `options`:
> 
> - the key is the same (for example, `tag`)
> - the value in `colors` is a object with `open` and `close` properties whose values are escape codes from [ansi-styles](https://github.com/chalk/ansi-styles) for the color value in `theme` (for example, `'cyan'`)
> 
> Some properties in `config` are derived from `min` in `options`:
> 
> - `spacingInner` and `spacingOuter` are **newline** if `min` is `false`
> - `spacingInner` is **space** and `spacingOuter` is **empty string** if `min` is `true`
> 
> ### Example of serialize and test
> 
> This plugin is a pattern you can apply to serialize composite data types. Of course, `pretty-format` does not need a plugin to serialize arrays :)
> 
> ```js
> // We reused more code when we factored out a function for child items
> // that is independent of depth, name, and enclosing punctuation (see below).
> const SEPARATOR = ',';
> function serializeItems(items, config, indentation, depth, refs, printer) {
>   if (items.length === 0) {
>     return '';
>   }
>   const indentationItems = indentation + config.indent;
>   return (
>     config.spacingOuter +
>     items
>       .map(
>         item =>
>           indentationItems +
>           printer(item, config, indentationItems, depth, refs), // callback
>       )
>       .join(SEPARATOR + config.spacingInner) +
>     (config.min ? '' : SEPARATOR) + // following the last item
>     config.spacingOuter +
>     indentation
>   );
> }
> 
> const plugin = {
>   test(val) {
>     return Array.isArray(val);
>   },
>   serialize(array, config, indentation, depth, refs, printer) {
>     const name = array.constructor.name;
>     return ++depth > config.maxDepth
>       ? '[' + name + ']'
>       : (config.min ? '' : name + ' ') +
>           '[' +
>           serializeItems(array, config, indentation, depth, refs, printer) +
>           ']';
>   },
> };
> ```
> 
> ```js
> const val = {
>   filter: 'completed',
>   items: [

> ### print
> 
> The **original** interface is adequate for plugins:
> 
> - that **do not** depend on options other than `highlight` or `min`
> - that **do not** depend on `depth` or `refs` in recursive traversal, and
> - if values either
>   - do **not** require indentation, or
>   - do **not** occur as children of JavaScript data structures (for example, array)
> 
> Write `print` to return a string, given the arguments:
> 
> - `val` which “passed the test”
> - current `printer(valChild)` callback function: serialize children
> - current `indenter(lines)` callback function: indent lines at the next level
> - unchanging `config` object: derived from `options`
> - unchanging `colors` object: derived from `options`
> 
> The 3 properties of `config` are `min` in `options` and:
> 
> - `spacing` and `edgeSpacing` are **newline** if `min` is `false`
> - `spacing` is **space** and `edgeSpacing` is **empty string** if `min` is `true`
> 
> Each property of `colors` corresponds to a property of `theme` in `options`:
>

> - the value in `colors` is a object with `open` and `close` properties whose values are escape codes from [ansi-styles](https://github.com/chalk/ansi-styles) for the color value in `theme` (for example, `'cyan'`)
> 
> ### Example of print and test
> 
> This plugin prints functions with the **number of named arguments** excluding rest argument.
> 
> ```js
> const plugin = {
>   print(val) {
>     return `[Function ${val.name || 'anonymous'} ${val.length}]`;
>   },
>   test(val) {
>     return typeof val === 'function';
>   },
> };
> ```
> 
> ```js
> const val = {
>   onClick(event) {},
>   render() {},
> };
> 
> prettyFormat(val, {
>   plugins: [plugin],
> });
> /*
> Object {

> */
> 
> prettyFormat(val);
> /*
> Object {
>   "onClick": [Function onClick],
>   "render": [Function render],
> }
> */
> ```
> 
> This plugin **ignores** the `printFunctionName` option. That limitation of the original `print` interface is a reason to use the improved `serialize` interface, described above.
> 
> ```js
> prettyFormat(val, {
>   plugins: [pluginOld],
>   printFunctionName: false,
> });
> /*
> Object {
>   "onClick": [Function onClick 1],
>   "render": [Function render 0],

## railroad-diagrams@1.0.0

* **License(s):** CC0-1.0
* **Repository:** https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams
* **Publisher:** Tab Atkins Jr.
* **Description:** A small JS+SVG library for drawing railroad syntax diagrams.
> Railroad-diagram Generator
> ==========================
> 
> This is a small js library for generating railroad diagrams
> (like what [JSON.org](http://json.org) uses)
> using SVG.
> 
> Railroad diagrams are a way of visually representing a grammar
> in a form that is more readable than using regular expressions or BNF.
> I think (though I haven't given it a lot of thought yet) that if it's easy to write a context-free grammar for the language,
> the corresponding railroad diagram will be easy as well.
> 
> There are several railroad-diagram generators out there, but none of them had the visual appeal I wanted.
> [Here's an example of how they look!](http://www.xanthir.com/etc/railroad-diagrams/example.html)
> And [here's an online generator for you to play with and get SVG code from!](http://www.xanthir.com/etc/railroad-diagrams/generator.html)
> 
> The library now exists in a Python port as well!  See the information further down.
> 
> Details
> -------
> 
> To use the library, just include the js and css files, and then call the Diagram() function.
> Its arguments are the components of the diagram (Diagram is a special form of Sequence).
> An alternative to Diagram() is ComplexDiagram() which is used to describe a complex type diagram.
> Components are either leaves or containers.
> 
> The leaves:
> * Terminal(text) or a bare string - represents literal text
> * NonTerminal(text) - represents an instruction or another production
> * Comment(text) - a comment
> * Skip() - an empty line
> 
> The containers:
> * Sequence(children) - like simple concatenation in a regex
> * Choice(index, children) - like | in a regex.  The index argument specifies which child is the "normal" choice and should go in the middle
> * Optional(child, skip) - like ? in a regex.  A shorthand for `Choice(1, [Skip(), child])`.  If the optional `skip` parameter has the value `"skip"`, it instead puts the Skip() in the straight-line path, for when the "normal" behavior is to omit the item.
> * OneOrMore(child, repeat) - like + in a regex.  The 'repeat' argument is optional, and specifies something that must go between the repetitions.
> * ZeroOrMore(child, repeat, skip) - like * in a regex.  A shorthand for `Optional(OneOrMore(child, repeat))`.  The optional `skip` parameter is identical to Optional().
> 
> For convenience, each component can be called with or without `new`.
> If called without `new`,
> the container components become n-ary;
> that is, you can say either `new Sequence([A, B])` or just `Sequence(A,B)`.
> 
> After constructing a Diagram, call `.format(...padding)` on it, specifying 0-4 padding values (just like CSS) for some additional "breathing space" around the diagram (the paddings default to 20px).
> 
> The result can either be `.toString()`'d for the markup, or `.toSVG()`'d for an `<svg>` element, which can then be immediately inserted to the document.  As a convenience, Diagram also has an `.addTo(element)` method, which immediately converts it to SVG and appends it to the referenced element with default paddings. `element` defaults to `document.body`.
> 
> Options
> -------
> 
> There are a few options you can tweak, at the bottom of the file.  Just tweak either until the diagram looks like what you want.
> You can also change the CSS file - feel free to tweak to your heart's content.
> Note, though, that if you change the text sizes in the CSS,
> you'll have to go adjust the metrics for the leaf nodes as well.
> 
> * VERTICAL_SEPARATION - sets the minimum amount of vertical separation between two items.  Note that the stroke width isn't counted when computing the separation; this shouldn't be relevant unless you have a very small separation or very large stroke width.
> * ARC_RADIUS - the radius of the arcs used in the branching containers like Choice.  This has a relatively large effect on the size of non-trivial diagrams.  Both tight and loose values look good, depending on what you're going for.
> * DIAGRAM_CLASS - the class set on the root `<svg>` element of each diagram, for use in the CSS stylesheet.
> * STROKE_ODD_PIXEL_LENGTH - the default stylesheet uses odd pixel lengths for 'stroke'. Due to rasterization artifacts, they look best when the item has been translated half a pixel in both directions. If you change the styling to use a stroke with even pixel lengths, you'll want to set this variable to `false`.
> * INTERNAL_ALIGNMENT - when some branches of a container are narrower than others, this determines how they're aligned in the extra space.  Defaults to "center", but can be set to "left" or "right".
> 
> Caveats
> -------
> 
> At this early stage, the generator is feature-complete and works as intended, but still has several TODOs:
> 
> * The font-sizes are hard-coded right now, and the font handling in general is very dumb - I'm just guessing at some metrics that are probably "good enough" rather than measuring things properly.
> 
> Python Port
> -----------
> 
> In addition to the canonical JS version, the library now exists as a Python library as well.
> 
> Using it is basically identical.  The config variables are globals in the file, and so may be adjusted either manually or via tweaking from inside your program.
> 
> The main difference from the JS port is how you extract the string from the Diagram.  You'll find a `writeSvg(writerFunc)` method on `Diagram`, which takes a callback of one argument and passes it the string form of the diagram.  For example, it can be used like `Diagram(...).writeSvg(sys.stdout.write)` to write to stdout.  **Note**: the callback will be called multiple times as it builds up the string, not just once with the whole thing.  If you need it all at once, consider something like a `StringIO` as an easy way to collect it into a single string.

> ```
> 
> If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:
> 
> ```
> [ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
> ```
> 
> The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
> longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
> next priority level is run.  See
> [PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
> even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
> can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:
> 
> ```
> [ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
> ```
> 
> ## API
> 
> ### const queue = new RunQueue(options)
> 
> Create a new queue. Options may contain:
> 
> * maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
> * Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.
> 
> ### queue.add (prio, fn, args)
> 
> Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
> with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.
> 
> ### queue.run ()
> 
> Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
> all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
> rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
> with that error and no further queue running will be done.
> 
> ## PRIORITIES
> 
> Priorities are any integer value >= 0.
> 
> Lowest is executed first.
> 
> Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
> must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.
> 
> This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
> must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
> while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
> queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
> complete.

> sane
> ----
> 
> I've been driven to insanity by node filesystem watcher wrappers.
> Sane aims to be fast, small, and reliable file system watcher. It does that by:
> 
> * By default stays away from fs polling because it's very slow and cpu intensive
> * Uses `fs.watch` by default and sensibly works around the various issues
> * Maintains a consistent API across different platforms
> * Where `fs.watch` is not reliable you have the choice of using the following alternatives:
>   * [the facebook watchman library](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/)
>   * polling
> 
> ## Install
> 
> ```
> $ npm install sane
> ```
> 
> ## How to choose a mode
> 
> Don't worry too much about choosing the correct mode upfront because sane
> maintains the same API across all modes and will be easy to switch.
> 
> * If you're only supporting Linux and OS X, `watchman` would be the most reliable mode
> * If you're using node > v0.10.0 use the default mode
> * If you're running OS X and you're watching a lot of directories and you're running into https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/5463, use `watchman`
> * If you're in an environment where native file system events aren't available (like Vagrant), you should use polling
> * Otherwise, the default mode should work well for you
> 
> ## API
> 
> ### sane(dir, options)
> 
> Watches a directory and all its descendant directories for changes, deletions, and additions on files and directories.
> 
> ```js
> var watcher = sane('path/to/dir', {glob: ['**/*.js', '**/*.css']});
> watcher.on('ready', function () { console.log('ready') });
> watcher.on('change', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file changed', filepath); });
> watcher.on('add', function (filepath, root, stat) { console.log('file added', filepath); });
> watcher.on('delete', function (filepath, root) { console.log('file deleted', filepath); });
> // close
> watcher.close();
> ```
> 
> options:
> 
> * `glob`: a single string glob pattern or an array of them.
> * `poll`: puts the watcher in polling mode. Under the hood that means `fs.watchFile`.
> * `watchman`: makes the watcher use [watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/).
> * `watchmanPath`: sets a custom path for `watchman` binary.
> * `dot`: enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.
> * `ignored`: a glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.
> 
> For the glob pattern documentation, see [micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).
> If you choose to use `watchman` you'll have to [install watchman yourself](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)).
> For the ignored options, see [anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch).
> 
> ### sane.NodeWatcher(dir, options)
> 
> The default watcher class. Uses `fs.watch` under the hood, and takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.
> 
> ### sane.WatchmanWatcher(dir, options)
> 
> The watchman watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)`.
> 
> ### sane.PollWatcher(dir, options)
> 
> The polling watcher class. Takes the same options as `sane(dir, options)` with the addition of:
> 
> * interval: indicates how often the files should be polled. (passed to fs.watchFile)
> 
> ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Poll}Watcher#close
> 
> Stops watching.
> 
> ### sane.{Node|Watchman|Poll}Watcher events
> 
> Emits the following events:
> 
> All events are passed the file/dir path relative to the root directory
> * `ready` when the program is ready to detect events in the directory
> * `change` when a file changes
> * `add` when a file or directory has been added
> * `delete` when a file or directory has been deleted
> 
> ## CLI
> 
> This module includes a simple command line interface, which you can install with `npm install sane -g`.
> 
> ```
> Usage: sane <command> [...directory] [--glob=<filePattern>] [--poll] [--watchman] [--watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>] [--dot] [--wait=<seconds>]
> 
> OPTIONS:
>     --glob=<filePattern>
>       A single string glob pattern or an array of them.
> 
>     --ignored=<filePattern>
>       A glob, regex, function, or array of any combination.
> 
>     --poll, -p
>       Use polling mode.
> 
>     --watchman, -w
>       Use watchman (if available).
> 
>     --watchman-path=<watchmanBinaryPath>
>       Sets a custom path for watchman binary (if using this mode).
> 
>     --dot, -d
>       Enables watching files/directories that start with a dot.
> 
>     --wait=<seconds>
>       Duration, in seconds, that watching will be disabled
>       after running <command>. Setting this option will
>       throttle calls to <command> for the specified duration.
> ```
> 
> It will watch the given `directory` and run the given <command> every time a file changes.
> 
> ### CLI example usage
> - `sane 'echo "A command ran"'`
> - `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css'`
> - `sane 'echo "A command ran"' site/assets/css --glob='**/*.css'`
> - `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --glob='**/*.css' --ignored='**/ignore.css'`
> - `sane 'echo "A command ran"' --wait=3`
> - `sane 'echo "A command ran"' -p`

> * [See Also](#see-also)
> * [Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass](#behavioral-differences-from-ruby-sass)
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> You can install Sass globally using `npm install -g sass` which will provide
> access to the `sass` executable. You can also add it to your project using
> `npm install --save-dev sass`. This provides the executable as well as a
> library:
> 
> [npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/sass
> 
> ```js
> var sass = require('sass');
> 
> sass.render({file: scss_filename}, function(err, result) { /* ... */ });
> 
> // OR
> 
> var result = sass.renderSync({file: scss_filename});
> ```
> 
> [See below](#api) for details on Dart Sass's JavaScript API.
> 
> ## API
> 
> When installed via npm, Dart Sass supports a JavaScript API that aims to be
> compatible with [Node Sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#usage). Full
> compatibility is a work in progress, but Dart Sass currently supports the
> `render()` and `renderSync()` functions. Note however that by default,
> **`renderSync()` is more than twice as fast as `render()`**, due to the overhead
> of asynchronous callbacks.
> 
> To avoid this performance hit, `render()` can use the [`fibers`][fibers] package
> to call asynchronous importers from the synchronous code path. To enable this,
> pass the `Fiber` class to the `fiber` option:
> 
> [fibers]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/fibers
> 
> ```js
> var sass = require("sass");
> var Fiber = require("fibers");
> 
> sass.render({
>   file: "input.scss",
>   importer: function(url, prev, done) {
>     // ...
>   },
>   fiber: Fiber
> }, function(err, result) {
>   // ...
> });
> ```
> 
> Both `render()` and `renderSync()` support the following options:
> 
> * [`data`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#data)
> * [`file`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#file)
> * [`functions`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#functions--v300---experimental)
> * [`importer`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#importer--v200---experimental)
> * [`includePaths`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#includepaths)
> * [`indentType`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#indenttype)
> * [`indentWidth`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#indentwidth)
> * [`indentedSyntax`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#indentedsyntax)
> * [`linefeed`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#linefeed)
> * [`omitSourceMapUrl`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#omitsourcemapurl)
> * [`outFile`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#outfile)
> * [`sourceMapContents`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemapcontents)
> * [`sourceMapEmbed`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemapembed)
> * [`sourceMapRoot`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemaproot)
> * [`sourceMap`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcemap)
> * Only the `"expanded"` and `"compressed"` values of
>   [`outputStyle`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#outputstyle) are supported.
> 
> No support is intended for the following options:
> 
> * [`precision`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#precision). Dart Sass defaults
>   to a sufficiently high precision for all existing browsers, and making this
>   customizable would make the code substantially less efficient.
> 
> * [`sourceComments`](https://github.com/sass/node-sass#sourcecomments). Source
>   maps are the recommended way of locating the origin of generated selectors.
> 
> ## See Also
> 
> * [Dart Sass][], from which this package is compiled, can be used either as a
>   stand-alone executable or as a Dart library. Running Dart Sass on the Dart VM
>   is substantially faster than running the pure JavaScript version, so this may
>   be appropriate for performance-sensitive applications. The Dart API is also
>   (currently) more user-friendly than the JavaScript API. See
>   [the Dart Sass README][Using Dart Sass] for details on how to use it.
> 
> * [Node Sass][], which is a wrapper around [LibSass][], the C++ implementation
>   of Sass. Node Sass supports the same API as this package and is also faster
>   (although it's usually a little slower than Dart Sass). However, it requires a
>   native library which may be difficult to install, and it's generally slower to
>   add features and fix bugs.

> 
> ## Behavioral Differences from Ruby Sass
> 
> There are a few intentional behavioral differences between Dart Sass and Ruby
> Sass. These are generally places where Ruby Sass has an undesired behavior, and
> it's substantially easier to implement the correct behavior than it would be to
> implement compatible behavior. These should all have tracking bugs against Ruby
> Sass to update the reference behavior.
> 
> 1. `@extend` only accepts simple selectors, as does the second argument of
>    `selector-extend()`. See [issue 1599][].
> 
> 2. Subject selectors are not supported. See [issue 1126][].
> 
> 3. Pseudo selector arguments are parsed as `<declaration-value>`s rather than
>    having a more limited custom parsing. See [issue 2120][].
> 
> 4. The numeric precision is set to 10. See [issue 1122][].
> 
> 5. The indented syntax parser is more flexible: it doesn't require consistent
>    indentation across the whole document. See [issue 2176][].
> 
> 6. Colors do not support channel-by-channel arithmetic. See [issue 2144][].
> 
> 7. Unitless numbers aren't `==` to unit numbers with the same value. In
>    addition, map keys follow the same logic as `==`-equality. See
>    [issue 1496][].
> 
> 8. `rgba()` and `hsla()` alpha values with percentage units are interpreted as
>    percentages. Other units are forbidden. See [issue 1525][].
> 
> 9. Too many variable arguments passed to a function is an error. See
>    [issue 1408][].
> 
> 10. Allow `@extend` to reach outside a media query if there's an identical
>     `@extend` defined outside that query. This isn't tracked explicitly, because
>     it'll be irrelevant when [issue 1050][] is fixed.
> 
> 11. Some selector pseudos containing placeholder selectors will be compiled
>     where they wouldn't be in Ruby Sass. This better matches the semantics of
>     the selectors in question, and is more efficient. See [issue 2228][].
> 
> 12. The old-style `:property value` syntax is not supported in the indented
>     syntax. See [issue 2245][].
> 
> 13. The reference combinator is not supported. See [issue 303][].
> 
> 14. Universal selector unification is symmetrical. See [issue 2247][].
> 
> 15. `@extend` doesn't produce an error if it matches but fails to unify. See
>     [issue 2250][].
> 
> 16. Dart Sass currently only supports UTF-8 documents. We'd like to support
>     more, but Dart currently doesn't support them. See [dart-lang/sdk#11744][],
>     for example.

> ## Writing a script
> 
> ```javascript
> var SauceLabs = require('saucelabs');
> 
> var myAccount = new SauceLabs({
>   username: "your-sauce-username",
>   password: "your-sauce-api-key"
> });
> 
> myAccount.getAccountDetails(function (err, res) {
>   console.log(res);
>   myAccount.getServiceStatus(function (err, res) {
>     // Status of the Sauce Labs services
>     console.log(res);
>     myAccount.getAllBrowsers(function (err, res) {
>       // List of all browser/os combinations currently supported on Sauce Labs
>       console.log(res);
>       myAccount.getJobs(function (err, jobs) {
>         // Get a list of all your jobs
>         for (var k in jobs) {
>           if ( jobs.hasOwnProperty( k )) {
>             myAccount.showJob(jobs[k].id, function (err, res) {
>               var str = res.id + ": Status: " + res.status;
>               if (res.error) {
>                 str += "\033[31m Error: " + res.error + " \033[0m";
>               }
>               console.log(str);
>             });
>           }
>         }
>       });
>     });
>   });
> });
> ```
> ## Using a proxy
> If you're behind a corporate firewall or would like to utilize a proxy, define it in the constructor like this:
> 
> ```javascript
> var sauce = new SauceLabs({
>   username: "your-sauce-username",
>   password: "your-sauce-api-key",
>   proxy: "https://your-proxy.com:8000"
> });
> ```

> 
> > Convert Windows backslash paths to slash paths: `foo\\bar` ➔ `foo/bar`
> 
> [Forward-slash paths can be used in Windows](http://superuser.com/a/176395/6877) as long as they're not extended-length paths and don't contain any non-ascii characters.

> 
> ## Install
> 
> ```sh
> $ npm install --save slash

> 
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ```js
> var path = require('path');
> var slash = require('slash');
> 
> var str = path.join('foo', 'bar');
> // Unix    => foo/bar
> // Windows => foo\\bar
> 
> slash(str);
> // Unix    => foo/bar
> // Windows => foo/bar
> ```
>

* **Description:** Istanbul instrumenter loader for webpack
> ## Istanbul instrumenter loader for [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
> 
> [![npm](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/istanbul-instrumenter-loader.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/istanbul-instrumenter-loader)
> [![deps](http://img.shields.io/david/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/deepsweet/istanbul-instrumenter-loader#info=dependencies)
> 
> Instrument JS files with [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) for subsequent code coverage reporting.
> 
> Using Babel to transpile ES6/ES7? Use [isparta-loader](https://github.com/deepsweet/isparta-loader) to coverage your original code.
> 
> ### Install
> 
> ```sh
> $ npm i -D istanbul-instrumenter-loader
> ```
> 
> ### Setup
> 
> #### References
> 
> * [Using loaders](https://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)

> #### Project structure
> 
> Let's say you have the following:
> 
> ```
> ├── src/
> │   └── components/
> │       ├── bar/
> │       │   └── index.js
> │       └── foo/
> │           └── index.js
> └── test/
>     └── src/
>         └── components/
>             └── foo/
>                 └── index.js
> ```
> 
> To create a code coverage report for all components (even for those for which you have no tests yet) you have to require all the 1) sources and 2) tests. Something like it's described in ["alternative usage" of karma-webpack](https://github.com/webpack/karma-webpack#alternative-usage):
> 
> #### test/index.js
> 
> ```js
> // require all `test/components/**/index.js`
> const testsContext = require.context('./src/components/', true, /index\.js$/);
> 
> testsContext.keys().forEach(testsContext);
> 
> // require all `src/components/**/index.js`
> const componentsContext = require.context('../src/components/', true, /index\.js$/);
> 
> componentsContext.keys().forEach(componentsContext);
> ```
> 
> This file will be the only entry point for Karma:
> 
> #### karma.conf.js
> 
> ```js
> config.set({
>     …
>     files: [
>         'test/index.js'
>     ],
>     preprocessors: {

## stable@0.1.8

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/Two-Screen/stable
* **Publisher:** Angry Bytes ( info@angrybytes.com )
* **Description:** A stable array sort for JavaScript
* **Copyright:** Copyright (C) 2018 Angry Bytes and contributors.

> ## Stable
> 
> A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.
> 
> MIT licensed.
> 
> [![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)
> 
> [![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)
> 
> #### From npm
> 
> Install with:
> 
> ```sh
> npm install stable
> ```
> 
> Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:
> 
> ```js
> const stable = require('stable')
> ```
> 
> #### From the browser
> 
> Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]
> in your page, then call `stable()`.
> 
>  [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js
>  [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js
> 
> #### Usage
> 
> The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:
> 
> ```js
> stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
> stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5]
> ```
> 
> Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
> sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:
> 
> ```js
> const arr = [10, 1, 5]
> stable(arr) === arr          // => false
> stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true
> ```
> 
> A comparator function can be specified:
> 
> ```js
> // Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
> // This demonstrates the default behavior.
> const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)
> stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
> 
> // Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.
> // This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.
> const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b
> stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]
> ```

## stripcomment-loader@0.1.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/IngwiePhoenix/commentstrip-loader
* **Publisher:** Ingwie Phoenix ( ingwie2000@gmail.com )
* **Description:** WebPack plugin to effectively strip comments
> # `stripcomments-loader` - A tiny loader to blanken your code.
> 
> While using UglifyJS over WebPack, I realized that the comments weren't stripped, actually. So I decided to write this loader that processes files and cleans them from comments - EXCEPT when debugging is enabled.
> 
> ## Usage
> It's recommended to use this as a `preLoaders` entry to process multiple files that use either `//` or `/* ... */` as comment indicators. Examples include JavaScript and CSS.
> 
> ```javascript
> module.exports = {
>     entry: "./test.js",
>     output: {
>         path: __dirname,
>         filename: "bundle.js"
>     },
>     module: {
>         preLoaders: [
>             {
>                 test: /\.(js|css)$/,
>                 loader: "stripcomments?-lines"
>             }
>         ]
>     }
> }
> ```
> 
> Now just require any JS or CSS file, and you should see comments getting stripped.
> 
> To retain comments, set `debug: true`. In this case, comments are kept in-place.
> 
> ## Query options
> You can control which and what is stripped:
> 
>     stripcomments?-block
> 
> This will **only** strip block comments. Adding `-line` will **only** strip line comments. Supplying both or none, then all will be stripped. Passing `+safe` will have extra effects on which comments are to be removed.

## tfunk@3.1.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/shakyShane/tfunk
* **Publisher:** Shane Osbourne
* **Description:** Multi-colour console output from chalk with added awesome
> ##tfunk [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shakyShane/tfunk.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/shakyShane/tfunk)
> 
> Multi-colour console output from [Chalk](https://github.com/sindresorhus/chalk#styles) with added awesome.
> 
> by [@shakyshane](https://github.com/shakyShane) & [@AydinHassan](https://github.com/AydinHassan)
> 
> ![tfunk](http://f.cl.ly/items/15102k441h1U1Z1l253J/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-10%20at%2022.05.15.png)
> 
> ##Install
> 
> ```bash
> npm install tfunk
> ```
> 
> ##Usage
> 
> **Syntax rules:**
> 
> `{` `<color>` `:` `YOUR STRING` `}`
> 
> **Example**
> 
> `{blue:This is a blue line}`
> 
> **`}` is optional**
> 
> `{blue:This is a blue line` <- Perfectly valid 
> 
> 
> ##Usage
> ```js
> var tFunk = require("tfunk");
> 
> console.log( tfunk("{cyan:tFunk terminal colours") )
> 
> // => tFunk terminal colours
> ```
> 
> Or get a custom compiler with a set prefix:
> 
> ```js
> var compiler = require("tfunk").Compiler({
>     prefix: "[{magenta:tFunk}]"
> });
> 
> console.log( compiler.compile("tFunk is awesome") );
> console.log( compiler.compile("don't you think?") );
> 
> // => [tFunk] tFunk is awesome
> // => [tFunk] don't you think?
> ```
> 
> **Define your own syntax**
> 
> You can define your own methods, they receive the string section as the first parameter & have access to the compiler
> through `this.compile()` keyword.
> 
> ```js
> var compiler = require("tfunk").Compiler({
>     "warn": function(string) {
>         return this.compile("{red:WARNING:" + string);
>     }
> });
> ```
> 
> Now you can use `warn` anywhere you like.
> 
> ```js
> console.log( compiler.compile("{warn: Could not file your config file...") );
> 
> // => WARNING: Could not file your config file...
> ```
> 
> ##Examples
> 
> Here are some comparisons to chalk, to help you understand how to use tFunk.
> 
> ###Single Colours
> 
> ```js
> // chalk
> console.log( chalk.red("This has a single colour") );
> 
> // tFunk
> console.log( tFunk("{red:This has a single colour") );
> ```
> 
> ###Single Colour mid string
> 
> ```js
> // chalk
> console.log( "This has a single colour " + chalk.cyan("that begins mid-string") );
> 
> // tFunck
> console.log( tFunk("This has a single colour {cyan:that begins mid-string") );
> ```
> 
> ###Single Colour with end point
> 
> ```js
> // chalk
> console.log( chalk.red("This has a single colour with ") + "an endpoint");
> 
> // tFunk
> console.log( tFunk("{red:This has a single colour with }an endpoint") );
> ```
> 
> ###Two Colours
> 
> ```js
> // chalk
> console.log( chalk.green("This has ") + chalk.cyan("two colours") );
> 
> // tFunk
> console.log( tFunk("{green:This has {cyan:two colours") );
> ```
> 
> ###Nested Colours
> 
> ```js
> // chalk
> console.log( chalk.green("This has a colour " + chalk.cyan("nested inside") + " another colour") );
> 
> //tFunk
> console.log( tFunk("{green:This has a colour {cyan:nested inside} another colour") );
> ```
> 
> ###Multiple Nested
> 
> ```js
> // chalk
> console.log( chalk.blue("Multiple " + chalk.cyan("NESTED") + " styles in " + chalk.red("the same string") + " with an ending") );
> 
> // tFunk
> console.log( tFunk("{blue:Multiple {cyan:NESTED} styles in {red:the same string} with an ending") );
> ```
> 
> ###Multi line
> ```js
> var multiline = require("multiline");
> 
> var string = multiline(function () {/*
> {cyan:This is a multi-line coloured string
> With a single {yellow:yellow} word in the center of a line
> Pretty cool huh?
> */});
> 
> console.log( tFunk(string) );
> ```
> 
> ###Escaping when you need curly braces
> ```js
> console.log( tFunk("This has a \\{\\{mustache\\}\\}") );
> ```
> 
> 
> ##TODO
> - [x] Colours
> - [x] Nested Colours
> - [x] Custom syntax
> - [x] Prefixed compiler
> - [x] Make the chain-able API work like this `"{white.bgRed: White text, red BG"`
> - [x] Offer a way of escaping. Right now, ALL instances of `}` will be lost

## to-string-loader@1.1.5

* **License(s):** BSD-3-Clause
* **Repository:** https://github.com/gajus/to-string-loader
* **Publisher:** Gajus Kuizinas ( gk@anuary.com )
* **Description:** to-string loader for webpack
> # to-string loader for webpack
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> ```js
> let output = require('to-string!css!sass!./my.scss');
> // => returns sass rendered to CSS a string
> ```
> 
> Don't forget to polyfill `require` if you want to use it in node.
> 
> See `webpack` documentation.
> 
> ## Use Case
> 
> If you setup a SASS loader:
> 
> ```js
> {
>     test: /\.scss$/,
>     loaders: [
>         'css',
>         'sass'
>     ]
> },
> ```
> 
> then `require('./my.scss')` will return an `Array` object:
> 
> ```
> 0: Array[3]
>     0: 223
>     1: "html,↵body,↵ol,↵ul,↵li,↵p { margin: 0; padding: 0; }↵"
>     2: ""
>     length: 3
> i: (modules, mediaQuery) { .. }
> length: 1
> toString: toString()
> ```
> 
> In some cases (e.g. Angular2 [@View styles definition](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/2e4a2a0e5a2fb5b5c531f16db88d00423ea582fc/modules/angular2/src/core/annotations_impl/view.ts#L58)) you need to have style as a string.
> 
> You can cast the require output to a string, e.g.
> 
> ```js
> @View({
>     directives: [RouterOutlet, RouterLink],
>     template: require('./app.html'),
>     styles: [
>         require('./app.scss').toString()
>     ]
> })
> ```
> 
> or you can use `to-string` loader that will do that for you:
> 
> ```js
> {
>     test: /\.scss$/,
>     loaders: [
>         'to-string',
>         'css',
>         'sass'
>     ]
> },
> ```

## tslint-react@3.6.0

* **License(s):** Apache-2.0
* **Repository:** https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react
* **Description:** Lint rules related to React & JSX for TSLint
> [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/tslint-react.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tslint-react)
> [![Downloads](http://img.shields.io/npm/dm/tslint-react.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/tslint-react)
> [![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/tslint-react.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/palantir/tslint-react)
> 
> tslint-react
> ------------
> 
> Lint rules related to React & JSX for [TSLint](https://github.com/palantir/tslint/).
> 
> ### Usage
> 
> tslint-react has peer dependencies on TSLint and TypeScript.
> 
> To use these lint rules with the default preset, use configuration inheritance via the `extends` keyword.
> Here's a sample configuration where `tslint.json` lives adjacent to your `node_modules` folder:
> 
> ```js
> {
>   "extends": ["tslint:latest", "tslint-react"],
>   "rules": {
>     // override tslint-react rules here
>     "jsx-wrap-multiline": false
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> To lint your `.ts` **and** `.tsx` files you can simply run `tslint -c tslint.json 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'`.
> 
> ### Semantic versioning
> 
> The built-in configuration preset you get with `"extends": "tslint-react"` is semantically versioned in a manner similar to TSLint's built-in presets and the TypeScript language itself. As new rules are added to tslint-react across minor versions, stricter checks may be enabled here. Your code is not guaranteed to continue passing checks across these version bumps. If you wish to ensure that `npm upgrade` or `yarn upgrade` never breaks your build, declare a tilde dependency on this package (e.g. `"~1.0.0"`).
> 
> ### Rules
> 
> - `jsx-alignment`
>   - Enforces a consistent style for multiline JSX elements which promotes ease of editing via line-wise manipulations
>   as well as maintainability via small diffs when changes are made.
>   ```ts
>   // Good:
>   const element = <div
>       className="foo"
>       tabIndex={1}
>   >
>       {children}
>   </div>;
> 
>   // Also Good:
>   <Button
>       appearance="pretty"
>       disabled
>       label="Click Me"
>       size={size}
>   />
>   ```
> - `jsx-ban-elements` (since v3.4.0)
>   - Allows blacklisting of JSX elements with an optional explanatory message in the reported failure.
> - `jsx-ban-props` (since v2.3.0)
>   - Allows blacklisting of props in JSX with an optional explanatory message in the reported failure.
> - `jsx-boolean-value` (since v2.5.0)
>   - When using a boolean attribute in JSX, you can set the attribute value to true or omit the value. This rule will enforce one or the other to keep consistency in your code.
>   - Rule options: `["always", "never"]`
>   - Default is set to `always`.
> - `jsx-curly-spacing` (since v1.1.0)
>   - Requires _or_ bans spaces between curly brace characters in JSX.
>   - Rule options: `["always", "never"]`
>   - _Includes automatic code fix_
> - `jsx-equals-spacing` (since v3.2.0)
>   - Requires _or_ bans spaces before and after the `=` token in JSX element attributes.
>   - Rule options: `["always", "never"]`
>   - _Includes automatic code fix_
> - `jsx-key` (since v3.2.0)
>   - Warns for missing `key` props in JSX element array literals and inside return statements of `Array.prototype.map` callbacks.
>     - N.B. This rule only does a simple check for `.map(...)` syntax and does not inspect computed types of expressions. As such, it may produce false positives if you use APIs that look similar to `.map()`.
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-no-bind` (since v2.6.0)
>   - Forbids function binding in JSX attributes. This has the same intent as `jsx-no-lambda` in helping you avoid excessive re-rendres.
>   - Note that this currently only does a simple _syntactic_ check, not a _semantic_ one (it doesn't use the type checker). So it may have some
>     rare false positives if you define your own `.bind` function and supply `this` as a parameter.
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-no-lambda`
>   - Creating new anonymous functions (with either the `function` syntax or ES2015 arrow syntax) inside the `render` call stack works against _pure component rendering_. When doing an equality check between two lambdas, React will always consider them unequal values and force the component to re-render more often than necessary.
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-no-multiline-js`
>   - Disallows multiline JS expressions inside JSX blocks to promote readability
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-no-string-ref`
>   - Passing strings to the `ref` prop of React elements is considered a legacy feature and will soon be deprecated.
>     Instead, [use a callback](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/more-about-refs.html#the-ref-callback-attribute).
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-use-translation-function` (since v2.4.0)
>    - Enforces use of a translation function. Plain string literals are disallowed in JSX when enabled.
>    - Rule options: `["allow-punctuation", "allow-htmlentities"]`
>    - Off by default
> - `jsx-self-close` (since v0.4.0)
>   - Enforces that JSX elements with no children are self-closing.
>   ```ts
>   // bad
>   <div className="foo"></div>
>   // good
>   <div className="foo" />
>   ```
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-space-before-trailing-slash`
>   - Checks that self-closing JSX elements have a space before the '/>' part.
>   - Rule options: _none_
> - `jsx-wrap-multiline` (since v2.1)
>   - Enforces that multiline JSX expressions are wrapped with parentheses.
>   - Opening parenthesis must be followed by a newline.
>   - Closing parenthesis must be preceded by a newline.
>   ```ts
>   // bad
>   const button = <button type="submit">
>       Submit
>   </button>;
>   // good
>   const button = (
>       <button type="submit">
>           Submit
>       </button>
>   );
>   ```
> 
> ### Development
> 
> We track rule suggestions on Github issues -- [here's a useful link](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Type%3A+Rule+Suggestion%22)
> to view all the current suggestions. Tickets are roughly triaged by priority (P1, P2, P3).
> 
> We're happy to accept PRs for new rules, especially those marked as [Status: Accepting PRs](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Status%3A+Accepting+PRs%22).
> If submitting a PR, try to follow the same style conventions as the [core TSLint project](https://github.com/palantir/tslint).
> 
> Quick Start (requires Node v6+, yarn v0.22+):
> 
> 1. `yarn`
> 1. `yarn verify`
> 1. `yarn lint`
> 
> ### Changelog
> 
> See the Github [release history](https://github.com/palantir/tslint-react/releases).

> 
> <img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/faisalman/ua-parser-js/gh-pages/images/logo.png"> A JavaScript-based User-Agent string parser. Can be used either in browser (client-side) or in node.js (server-side) environment. Also available as jQuery/Zepto plugin, Bower/Meteor package, & RequireJS/AMD module. This library aims to identify detailed type of web browser, layout engine, operating system, cpu architecture, and device type/model, entirely from user-agent string with a relatively small footprint (~11KB when minified / ~4KB gzipped). Written in vanilla JavaScript, which means it doesn't require any other library and can be used independently. However, it's not recommended to use this library as browser detection since the result may not accurate than using feature detection.

> ```
> 
> ## Using bower
> 
> ```sh
> $ bower install ua-parser-js
> ```
> 
> ## Using meteor
> 
> ```sh
> $ meteor add faisalman:ua-parser-js
> ```
> 
> ## Using CLI
> 
> ```sh
> $ node ua-parser.min.js "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 4.01; Windows 98)"
> # multiple args
> $ node ua-parser.min.js "Opera/1.2" "Opera/3.4"
> # piped args
> $ echo "Opera/1.2" | node ua-parser.min.js
> # log file
> $ cat ua.log | node ua-parser.min.js
> ```
> 
> ## Using jQuery/Zepto ($.ua)
> 
> Although written in vanilla js (which means it doesn't depends on jQuery), this library will automatically detect if jQuery/Zepto is present and create `$.ua` object based on browser's user-agent (although in case you need, `window.UAParser` constructor is still present). To get/set user-agent you can use: `$.ua.get()` / `$.ua.set(uastring)`. 
> 
> ```js
> // In browser with default user-agent: 'Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.4; en-us; Sprint APA7373KT Build/GRJ22) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0':
> 
> // Do some tests
> console.log($.ua.device);           // {vendor: "HTC", model: "Evo Shift 4G", type: "mobile"}
> console.log($.ua.os);               // {name: "Android", version: "2.3.4"}
> console.log($.ua.os.name);          // "Android"
> console.log($.ua.get());            // "Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.3.4; en-us; Sprint APA7373KT Build/GRJ22) AppleWebKit/533.1 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0"
> 
> // reset to custom user-agent
> $.ua.set('Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 3.0.1; en-us; Xoom Build/HWI69) AppleWebKit/534.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Safari/534.13');
> 
> // Test again
> console.log($.ua.browser.name);     // "Safari"
> console.log($.ua.engine.name);      // "Webkit"
> console.log($.ua.device);           // {vendor: "Motorola", model: "Xoom", type: "tablet"}
> console.log(parseInt($.ua.browser.version.split('.')[0], 10));  // 4
> 
> // Add class to <body> tag
> // <body class="ua-browser-safari ua-devicetype-tablet">
> $('body').addClass('ua-browser-' + $.ua.browser.name + ' ua-devicetype-' + $.ua.device.type);
> ```
> 
> ## Extending regex patterns
> 
> * `UAParser([uastring,] extensions)`
> 
> Pass your own regexes to extend the limited matching rules.
> 
> ```js
> // Example:
> var myOwnRegex = [[/(myownbrowser)\/([\w\.]+)/i], [UAParser.BROWSER.NAME, UAParser.BROWSER.VERSION]];
> var myParser = new UAParser({ browser: myOwnRegex });
> var uaString = 'Mozilla/5.0 MyOwnBrowser/1.3';

## uniqs@2.0.0

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/fgnass/uniqs
* **Publisher:** Felix Gnass ( fgnass@gmail.com )
* **Description:** Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists
> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs)
> 
> ### Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```js
> var uniqs = require('uniqs');
> 
> var foo = { foo: 23 };
> var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];
> 
> uniqs(list);
> // => [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }]
> ```
> 
> You can pass multiple lists to create a union:
> 
> ```js
> uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]);
> // => [2, 1, 3, 4]
> ```
> 
> Passing individual items works too:
> ```js
> uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]);
> // => [3, 2, 1]
> ```
> 
> ### Summary
> 
> * Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality.
> * The lists do not need to be sorted.
> * The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.
> 
> ### About
> 
> This package has been written to accompany utilities like
> [flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown
> libraries like underscore or lodash.
> 
> The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and
> looks like this:
> 
> ```js
> module.exports = function uniqs() {
>   var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);
>   return list.filter(function(item, i) {
>     return i == list.indexOf(item);
>   });
> };
> ```

## uri-js@4.2.2

* **License(s):** BSD-2-Clause
* **Repository:** https://github.com/garycourt/uri-js
* **Publisher:** Gary Court ( gary.court@gmail.com )
* **Description:** An RFC 3986/3987 compliant, scheme extendable URI/IRI parsing/validating/resolving library for JavaScript.
* **Copyright:** Copyright 2011 Gary Court. All rights reserved.

> # URI.js
> 
> URI.js is an [RFC 3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) compliant, scheme extendable URI parsing/validating/resolving library for all JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js, etc).
> It is also compliant with the IRI ([RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt)), IDNA ([RFC 5890](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5890.txt)), IPv6 Address ([RFC 5952](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5952.txt)), IPv6 Zone Identifier ([RFC 6874](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6874.txt)) specifications.
> 
> URI.js has an extensive test suite, and works in all (Node.js, web) environments. It weighs in at 6.2kb (gzipped, 16kb deflated).
> 
> ## API
> 
> ### Parsing
> 
> 	URI.parse("uri://user:pass@example.com:123/one/two.three?q1=a1&q2=a2#body");
> 	//returns:
> 	//{
> 	//  scheme : "uri",
> 	//  userinfo : "user:pass",
> 	//  host : "example.com",
> 	//  port : 123,
> 	//  path : "/one/two.three",
> 	//  query : "q1=a1&q2=a2",
> 	//  fragment : "body"
> 	//}
> 
> ### Serializing
> 
> 	URI.serialize({scheme : "http", host : "example.com", fragment : "footer"}) === "http://example.com/#footer"
> 
> ### Resolving
> 
> 	URI.resolve("uri://a/b/c/d?q", "../../g") === "uri://a/g"
> 
> ### Normalizing
> 
> 	URI.normalize("HTTP://ABC.com:80/%7Esmith/home.html") === "http://abc.com/~smith/home.html"
> 
> ### Comparison
> 
> 	URI.equal("example://a/b/c/%7Bfoo%7D", "eXAMPLE://a/./b/../b/%63/%7bfoo%7d") === true
> 
> ### IP Support
> 
> 	//IPv4 normalization
> 	URI.normalize("//192.068.001.000") === "//192.68.1.0"
> 
> 	//IPv6 normalization
> 	URI.normalize("//[2001:0:0DB8::0:0001]") === "//[2001:0:db8::1]"
> 
> 	//IPv6 zone identifier support
> 	URI.parse("//[2001:db8::7%25en1]");
> 	//returns:
> 	//{
> 	//  host : "2001:db8::7%en1"
> 	//}
> 
> ### IRI Support
> 
> 	//convert IRI to URI
> 	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://examplé.org/rosé")) === "http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"
> 	//convert URI to IRI
> 	URI.serialize(URI.parse("http://xn--exampl-gva.org/ros%C3%A9"), {iri:true}) === "http://examplé.org/rosé"
> 
> ### Options
> 
> All of the above functions can accept an additional options argument that is an object that can contain one or more of the following properties:
> 
> *	`scheme` (string)
> 
> 	Indicates the scheme that the URI should be treated as, overriding the URI's normal scheme parsing behavior.
> 
> *	`reference` (string)
> 
> 	If set to `"suffix"`, it indicates that the URI is in the suffix format, and the validator will use the option's `scheme` property to determine the URI's scheme.
> 
> *	`tolerant` (boolean, false)
> 
> 	If set to `true`, the parser will relax URI resolving rules.
> 
> *	`absolutePath` (boolean, false)
> 
> 	If set to `true`, the serializer will not resolve a relative `path` component.
> 
> *	`iri` (boolean, false)
> 
> 	If set to `true`, the serializer will unescape non-ASCII characters as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).
> 
> *	`unicodeSupport` (boolean, false)
> 
> 	If set to `true`, the parser will unescape non-ASCII characters in the parsed output as per [RFC 3987](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt).
> 
> *	`domainHost` (boolean, false)
> 
> 	If set to `true`, the library will treat the `host` component as a domain name, and convert IDNs (International Domain Names) as per [RFC 5891](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5891.txt).
> 
> ## Scheme Extendable
> 
> URI.js supports inserting custom [scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI_scheme) dependent processing rules. Currently, URI.js has built in support for the following schemes:
> 
> *	http \[[RFC 2616](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2616.txt)\]
> *	https \[[RFC 2818](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2818.txt)\]
> *	mailto \[[RFC 6068](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc6068.txt)\]
> *	urn \[[RFC 2141](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2141.txt)\]
> *	urn:uuid \[[RFC 4122](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4122.txt)\]
> 
> ### HTTP Support
> 
> 	URI.equal("HTTP://ABC.COM:80", "http://abc.com/") === true
> 
> ### Mailto Support
> 
> 	URI.parse("mailto:alpha@example.com,bravo@example.com?subject=SUBSCRIBE&body=Sign%20me%20up!");
> 	//returns:
> 	//{
> 	//	scheme : "mailto",
> 	//	to : ["alpha@example.com", "bravo@example.com"],
> 	//	subject : "SUBSCRIBE",
> 	//	body : "Sign me up!"
> 	//}
> 
> 	URI.serialize({
> 		scheme : "mailto",
> 		to : ["alpha@example.com"],
> 		subject : "REMOVE",
> 		body : "Please remove me",
> 		headers : {
> 			cc : "charlie@example.com"
> 		}
> 	}) === "mailto:alpha@example.com?cc=charlie@example.com&subject=REMOVE&body=Please%20remove%20me"
> 
> ### URN Support
> 
> 	URI.parse("urn:example:foo");
> 	//returns:
> 	//{
> 	//	scheme : "urn",
> 	//	nid : "example",
> 	//	nss : "foo",
> 	//}
> 
> #### URN UUID Support
> 
> 	URI.parse("urn:uuid:f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6");
> 	//returns:
> 	//{
> 	//	scheme : "urn",
> 	//	nid : "example",
> 	//	uuid : "f81d4fae-7dec-11d0-a765-00a0c91e6bf6",
> 	//}
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> To load in a browser, use the following tag:
> 
> 	<script type="text/javascript" src="uri-js/dist/es5/uri.all.min.js"></script>
> 
> To load in a CommonJS (Node.js) environment, first install with npm by running on the command line:
> 
> 	npm install uri-js
> 
> Then, in your code, load it using:
> 
> 	const URI = require("uri-js");
> 
> If you are writing your code in ES6+ (ESNEXT) or TypeScript, you would load it using:
> 
> 	import * as URI from "uri-js";
> 
> Or you can load just what you need using named exports:
> 
> 	import { parse, serialize, resolve, resolveComponents, normalize, equal, removeDotSegments, pctEncChar, pctDecChars, escapeComponent, unescapeComponent } from "uri-js";
> 
> ## Breaking changes
> 
> ### Breaking changes from 3.x
> 
> URN parsing has been completely changed to better align with the specification. Scheme is now always `urn`, but has two new properties: `nid` which contains the Namspace Identifier, and `nss` which contains the Namespace Specific String. The `nss` property will be removed by higher order scheme handlers, such as the UUID URN scheme handler.
> 
> The UUID of a URN can now be found in the `uuid` property.
> 
> ### Breaking changes from 2.x
> 
> URI validation has been removed as it was slow, exposed a vulnerabilty, and was generally not useful.
> 
> ### Breaking changes from 1.x
> 
> The `errors` array on parsed components is now an `error` string.

## v8-compile-cache@2.0.2

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Publisher:** Andres Suarez ( zertosh@gmail.com )
* **Description:** Require hook for automatic V8 compile cache persistence
> # v8-compile-cache
> 
> [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/v8-compile-cache.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/zertosh/v8-compile-cache)
> 
> `v8-compile-cache` attaches a `require` hook to use [V8's code cache](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2015/07/code-caching.html) to speed up instantiation time. The "code cache" is the work of parsing and compiling done by V8.
> 
> The ability to tap into V8 to produce/consume this cache was introduced in [Node v5.7.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v5.7.0/).
> 
> ## Usage
> 
> 1. Add the dependency:
> 
>   ```sh
>   $ npm install --save v8-compile-cache
>   ```
> 
> 2. Then, in your entry module add:
> 
>   ```js
>   require('v8-compile-cache');
>   ```
> 
> **Requiring `v8-compile-cache` in Node <5.7.0 is a noop – but you need at least Node 4.0.0 to support the ES2015 syntax used by `v8-compile-cache`.**
> 
> ## Options
> 
> Set the environment variable `DISABLE_V8_COMPILE_CACHE=1` to disable the cache.
> 
> ## Internals
> 
> The caches are stored in `$TMP/v8-compile-cache/V8_VERSION`, where there are `.BLOB` and `.MAP` files corresponding to the entry module that required `v8-compile-cache`. The cache is _entry module specific_ because it is faster to load the entire code cache into memory at once, than it is to read it from disk on a file-by-file basis.
> 
> ## Benchmarks
> 
> See https://github.com/zertosh/v8-compile-cache/tree/master/bench.
> 
> **Load Times:**
> 
> | Module           | Without Cache | With Cache |
> | ---------------- | -------------:| ----------:|
> | `babel-core`     | `218ms`       | `185ms`    |
> | `yarn`           | `153ms`       | `113ms`    |
> | `yarn` (bundled) | `228ms`       | `105ms`    |
> 
> _^ Includes the overhead of loading the cache itself._
> 
> ## Acknowledgements
> 
> * `FileSystemBlobStore` and `NativeCompileCache` are based on Atom's implementation of their v8 compile cache:

## w3c-hr-time@1.0.1

* **License(s):** MIT
* **Repository:** https://github.com/jsdom/w3c-hr-time
* **Publisher:** Timothy Gu ( timothygu99@gmail.com )
* **Description:** An implementation of the W3C High Resolution Time Level 2 specification.
> # w3c-hr-time
> 
> This module implements the W3C [High Resolution Time Level 2][HR-TIME] specification. It provides exactly three exports:
> 
> - `Performance` class
> - `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS(): number`
> - `clockIsAccurate: boolean`
> 
> In all APIs, a "high-resolution timestamp" means a number in milliseconds that may have a fractional part, if the system clock is accurate enough (see "Clock accuracy" section below). It is identical to the [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] type in the High Resolution Time spec.
> 
> Portability is paramount to this module. It uses only APIs exposed from Node.js core like `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()` and does not use or require any native modules. It also employs the [browser-process-hrtime][] module for graceful degrades for platforms that do not have `process.hrtime()` (such as browsers).
> 
> ## `Performance` class
> 
> ```js
> const { Performance } = require("w3c-hr-time");
> const performance = new Performance();
> 
> console.log(performance.timeOrigin);
> // Prints a number close to Date.now() but that may have fractional parts, like
> // 1514888563819.351.
> 
> console.log(new Date(performance.timeOrigin));
> // Prints a date close to new Date(), like 2018-01-02T10:22:43.819Z.
> 
> setTimeout(() => {
>   console.log(performance.now());
>   // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5008.023059.
> }, 5000);
> ```
> 
> Perhaps the most interesting export is the [`Performance`][] class. By constructing the class, you can get an instance quite similar to the `window.performance` object in browsers. Specifically, the following APIs are implemented:
> 
> * [`performance.now(): number`][`Performance#now()`] returns the high-resolution duration since the construction of the `Performance` object.
> * [`performance.timeOrigin: number`][`Performance#timeOrigin`] is a high-resolution timestamp of the `Performance` object's construction, expressed in [Unix time][].
> * [`performance.toJSON(): object`][`Performance#toJSON()`] returns an object with `timeOrigin` property set to the corresponding value of this object. This allows serializing the `Performance` object with `JSON.stringify()`. In browsers, the returned object may contain additional properties such as `navigation` and `timing`. However, those properties are specific to browser navigation and are unsuitable for a Node.js implementation. Furthermore, they are specified not in the High Resolution Time spec but in [Navigation Timing][NAVIGATION-TIMING], and are thereby outside the scope of this module.
> 
> ### Limitations
> 
> This module does not aim for full [Web IDL][WEBIDL] conformance, so things like `performance.toJSON.call({})` will not throw `TypeError`s like it does in browsers. If you need full Web IDL conformance, you may be interested in the [webidl2js][] module.
> 
> The `Performance` class provided also does not have `mark()`, `measure()`, `getEntries()`, and such functions. They are specified in other specs than High Resolution Timing, such as [User Timing][USER-TIMING] (marks and measures) and [Performance Timeline][PERFORMANCE-TIMELINE] (entries management). Those specs extend the definition of the `Performance` class defined in High Resolution Timing, and to implement those specs you can extend the `Performance` class exported by this module.
> 
> Due to the limitations of the APIs exposed through Node.js, the construction of a `Performance` object may take up to 1 millisecond to gather information for high-resolution `timeOrigin`.
> 
> ## Global monotonic clock
> 
> The High Resolution Time spec defines a [global monotonic clock][] that is "shared by time origin's *[sic]*, is monotonically increasing and not subject to system clock adjustments or system clock skew, and whose reference point is the Unix time."
> 
> This module exports a function `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` that is the basis of all timing functions used my this module when a monotonic time is required. It returns a high-resolution timestamp whose zero value is at some arbitrary point in the past. (For the current high-resolution timestamp based on the Unix epoch, use `new Performance().timeOrigin` instead.)
> 
> ```js
> const { getGlobalMonotonicClockMS } = require("w3c-hr-time");
> 
> const start = getGlobalMonotonicClockMS();
> console.log(start);
> // Prints a millisecond timestamp based on an arbitrary point in the past, like
> // 280249733.012151.
> 
> setTimeout(() => {
>   console.log(getGlobalMonotonicClockMS() - a);
>   // Prints a number close to 5000, like 5006.156536.
> }, 5000);
> ```
> 
> Unlike other functions that return only integer timestamps if the system clock does not provide enough resolution, this function may still return timestamps with fractional parts on those systems with less accurate clocks. See "Clock accuracy" section below for more information.
> 
> ## Clock accuracy
> 
> The High Resolution Time spec [states][HR-TIME §4] that
> 
> > A [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] *SHOULD* represent a time in milliseconds accurate to 5 microseconds - see [8. Privacy and Security][HR-TIME §8].
> >
> > If the User Agent is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds due to hardware or software constraints, the User Agent can represent a [`DOMHighResTimeStamp`][] as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.
> 
> This module implements this suggestion faithfully. It executes a test at `require()`-time to determine if the system clock (both `Date.now()` and `process.hrtime()`) is accurate enough to 5 microseconds. The result of this test can be accessed through the exported `clockIsAccurate` boolean value.
> 
> ```js
> const { Performance, clockIsAccurate } = require("w3c-hr-time");
> 
> const performance = new Performance();
> 
> if (!clockIsAccurate) {
>   console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.timeOrigin));
>   console.assert(Number.isInteger(performance.now()));
> }
> ```
> 
> If `clockIsAccurate` is false, `performance.timeOrigin` and `performance.now()` are always rounded to millisecond accuracy. `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` however is exempt from this requirement due to its best-effort nature, and the fact that it is not an API exposed by the High Resolution Time spec.
> 
> ## Clock drift
> 
> [Clock drift][clock drift] can be observed through system or user clock adjustments -- that is, the speed at which `Date.now()` changes may be faster or slower than real time if there is a pending adjustment to the system clock, for example through NTP synchronizing.
> 
> In the spec, the [global monotonic clock][] is defined to be immune to such drifts. Correspondingly, the APIs exposed through this module that are defined using the global monotonic clock such as `performance.now()` and `getGlobalMonotonicClockMS()` are also guaranteed to reflect real time.
> 
> For example, if `performance.now()` returns 1000, it is guaranteed that the time of this call is exactly one second since the construction of the `Performance` object. But the difference in `Date.now()`'s value from the construction of the `Performance` object to when `performance.now()` returns 1000 may not be exactly 1000. You may also see `performance.now() - Date.now()` diverge over time as a result of clock drifts.
> 
> On the other hand, `performance.timeOrigin` returns the *[Unix time][]* at which the `Performance` object is constructed and relies on the current time exposed through `Date.now()`. That means that it is susceptible to clock drifts that has occurred before the `Performance` object was constructed.
